    <title>Best House Plants For Your Home - That Are Nearly Impossible To Kill...</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>Has anyone else developed a green thumb over the last year?<br><br>We have!<br><br>It's been a year of DIY's, puzzles, baking bread, home reno's, whipping up Dalagona coffee, tie-dyeing EVERYTHING, and attempting TikTok dances (we know we aren't the only ones)<br><br>Through all of these trends, one has jumped to the forefront and we think it's here to stay! House plants! If you're like us we tend to have a bad track record when it comes to keeping plants alive... we have the best of intentions but no matter what we do we can't seem to keep a single green thing alive.<br><br>Instead of feeling bad about our poor plant parenting skills we have scoured the web and have found the top 8 house plants for beginners! So wave your green thumb proudly and prepare to become a flourishing plant mom!<br><br><span><strong>1.) Snake Plant</strong></span></p>
<p>My fave, stylish, sleek, and one of the best plants for beginners because it's nearly impossible to kill. You can grow them in low light and only need to water them occasionally (major plus) and to top it off Snake plants also remove toxins from the air so really it's a win-win relationship.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0510/7951/2261/files/Plants_2_480x480.jpg?v=1619211264" alt="" width="312" height="312"><br><br><span><strong>2.) Heartleaf Philodendron</strong></span><br>Sounds WAY more complicated than it is. They are easy to grow, and do better when the soil dries out between watering so forgetting for a few days is no big deal!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0510/7951/2261/files/Plants_3_480x480.jpg?v=1619211307" alt="" width="315" height="315"><br><br><span><strong>3.) Spider Plant</strong></span><br>You probably recognize this one, it's VERY popular because it's so easy to grow and maintain. Spider plants can grow in almost any condition, just keep it bright and slightly moist and it will grow happy and healthy.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0510/7951/2261/files/Plants_4_480x480.jpg?v=1619211337" alt="" width="321" height="321"><br><br><span><strong>4.) Monstera</strong></span><br>This ultra-pretty plant looks high maintenance but is perfect for a forgetful plant parent. The Monstera is a climber plant so you should give her, her own space, in an area without direct sunlight and try to water once per week, or when the soil is fairly dry. Done, and done!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0510/7951/2261/files/Plants_5_480x480.jpg?v=1619211346" alt="" width="324" height="324"><br><br><span><strong>5.) Rubber Plant</strong></span><br>On the bigger side of the house plant family but, look at the name, It's durable. Low maintenance and easy to grow. Keep it in a well-lit position in your home and allow the soil to dry out between watering spells. Also, like the Snake plant, it has air-purifying abilities.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0510/7951/2261/files/Plants_6_480x480.jpg?v=1619211355" alt="" width="327" height="327"><br><br><span><strong>6.) English Ivy</strong></span><br>No poison here! English Ivy is very hardy and easy to grow. Keep the pot in a spot that receives bright indirect sun and plant it in a container that is wide and shallow for best results.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0510/7951/2261/files/Plants_7_480x480.jpg?v=1619211364" alt="" width="331" height="331"><br><br><span><strong>7.) Jade Plant</strong></span><br>The Jade plant is in the succulent family and is probably one of the best houseplants for beginners so it had to make the list. Keep the plant in a spot that receives partial or indirect sunlight, and if you take care of it, it can grow to the size of a small shrub!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0510/7951/2261/files/Plants_8_480x480.jpg?v=1619211375" alt="" width="328" height="328"><br><br><span><strong>8.) Succulents and Cactus</strong></span><br>We couldn't leave this very trendy option off our list! You could even say we left the easiest for last! Succulents and cacti are ideal for those who forget to water and care for plants. They are very adaptable and can survive in almost any condition. Place them in a bright spot and with little water.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Season of Giving! </span></strong></p>
<p>Here at CorLiving, we have always made it a priority to support charities affiliated with Autism support and awareness. This disorder hits close to home for us just as it does for many families in Canada. As we gear up for Giving Tuesday, during an especially tough year we are focusing on promoting Autism awareness and how you can help! <br><br>We asked one of our team members who has been directly affected by Autism to give us a first-hand look at how her family copes. <br><br>An estimated one in every 66 Canadian children and youth aged five to 17 have Autism spectrum disorder. Having such a large number among Canadians is surprising especially when many of us don't know much about the disorder and how autism affects children and their families. <br><br>"People need to know there is nothing wrong with them, they are like any other child, it takes a lot of work, support, and therapy to up his levels. - <em>Brandy, CorLiving Team Member</em><br><br>Typically detected in early childhood, some of the effects cause impairments in communication skills and social interactions, often combined with repetitive behaviors and restricted interests or activities. Although autism affects everyone, boys are four to five times more likely to be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, than girls.<br><br>"Jayden, my son, is 12 years old. When he was around three I noticed that he was struggling with quick changes, the way he played seemed a bit different, I just had a feeling something was up. We got an assessment and it came back as negative, they said it was just anxiety. After 3 years, I was documenting everything he did to be able to get a second opinion and testing, as I knew, as he developed, that something was just not right. Finally, at five years old, we got a second assessment and it came back positive. We were lucky as many families don't get the secondary testing, it's very rare" -<em> Brandy</em><br><br>Many of us don't know much about ASD, we also tend to assume it is an all-encompassing disorder however, individuals on the autism spectrum tend to have varying degrees and combinations of symptoms, and therefore, treatment must be specific to the individual. There is no standard “type” or “typical” person with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. <br><br>In order to have the support needed to address specific needs for every person costs money, time, and sacrifice. Many families are just doing the best they can with the circumstances they are in. Government funding is quickly used up to get the care these individuals need. <br><br>" I had to move because there are no support systems for autism in smaller towns. We moved to Vancouver for more opportunities, resources and it has been easier to find help here" - <em>Brandy</em> <br><br>Parents and Families sacrifice so much to give their children whatever they can, but the stress and extra time and effort it takes to adapt to life with Autism can take a toll on the parents. <br><br>"There is an initial shock, but you take it day by day, it does get easier" -<em>Brandy</em><br><br>It is so important to speak out about Autism, especially with diagnosis rates being so high in Canada, We at CorLiving want to always shine a spotlight on this disorder, to educate and help support those living with Autism. <br><br>" It's important to be aware because when people don't know they might not be aware of the signs, to get a diagnosis you need to be aware of your child. The more people that know about Autism, the more others will understand." - <em>Brandy</em> <br><br>There are many outlets for information about Autism, we have linked a list of resources below. <br><br>If you want to support <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/corliving-cares">click here</a> to purchase a stuffed animal, 100% of the proceeds go towards Autism charities helping kids and families all over Canada <br><br>" I've purchased 3, to support, because I know how it helps" - <em>Brandy</em></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Thanksgiving is this weekend, can you believe it! Although our gatherings are <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/pages/our-response-to-covid-19">smaller </a>this year than last we have a few helpful tips to make your dining table look and feel as festive as it can. <br><br>We may have to skimp on the invites but not on the <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/dining-sets">décor</a>! <br><br>Autumn is our favorite time of year, cozy blankets, pumpkin spice everything and the fireplace is in full use. One of the best things about fall is the décor, it adds a warm comforting hue to any space with rich colors and natural accents, many of which you can find outside (hello, budget-friendly!) <br><br>Here are some tricks to get the most festive looks for less! <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dining Room:</strong> </span></p>
<p>Maybe the most important, it's the center of any Thanksgiving dinner. A great way to <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/dining-sets">upgrade</a> a drab table is to add a few touches with warm tones and layers of texture.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/Annotation_2020-10-07_114448_480x480.jpg?v=1602096299" alt="Dining set"><br><br>We have added a light runner to accent our rich brown <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/dining-sets/products/branson-dining-set-4pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Branson dining table set</a>. To give it some texture and height, we paired it with green leaf garland that you can find at any local dollar store! Add in a few mini pumpkins, chestnuts or pinecones that are EVERYWHERE right now. Finish it off with some candles to set the cozy mood. <br><br>If you want to be a bit extra (we did!) a great DIY is to print out your menus. Grab some rosemary, which not only looks great but smells amazing! Tie it up with a string or ribbon, whatever you have on hand and you have a chic place setting for your guests.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/Annotation_2020-10-07_114130_480x480.jpg?v=1602096126" alt="Dining table with fall décor"><br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Living Room:</strong> </span><br><br>It's amazing what some florals and a little pillow refresh can do to any <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/sofas-loveseats">space</a>. We grabbed some pillow covers in what may be the color of the season, Yellow! and paired it with a neutral throw on our <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/accent-chairs/products/modern-high-grade-durable-faux-leather-low-profile-chair?variant=31470736670804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">London accent chair</a>. Fresh flowers and greenery are a great addition to add some warmth to your space add in a candle to finish the look!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/Annotation_2020-10-07_114329_480x480.jpg?v=1602096229" alt="Accent Chair and Side table"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pro tip</strong></span> - Pillow covers are an inexpensive buy and can be thrown over existing pillow forms to completely refresh the look of any room, living, bedroom, and guestroom. Switch out your colors for any season to give a fresh look without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Happy decorating! </p>

      <![CDATA[<p>We all love <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/pages/2020-patio-dreambook">patio season</a>, dinner, or drinks in the sun, relaxing by the pool, reading in your favorite chair while working on your tan.</p>
<p>Ahh, Summer.</p>
<p>Then, in a flash, you're looking outside at clouds, rain, and <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blogs/news/autumn-decor-made-easy">falling</a> leaves, this is mother nature's not so subtle cue to pack it up for next year. <br><br>Outdoor furniture is durable and can weather the sun and rain but you want to make sure you keep it clean and stored properly for those cold months to prolong your enjoyment of your patio pieces year after year. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to store your Outdoor Furniture</strong> </span><br>We know, we know... we sound like your mother BUT the best way to keep your outdoor patio furniture looking great is prevention. Although these pieces are meant for outdoor use you don't want it sitting out in a 4-day downpour in the middle of August. A furniture cover is a great quick and easy fix to help your patio set last longer. Not only does it protect from rain, intense sun, leaves, dirt and grime, bugs, and those flying birds who have great aim.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=patio+furniture+covers+waterproof&amp;crid=1F3JG7EPG2KVG&amp;sprefix=patio+furnitur%2Caps%2C207&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-oa-p_5_14"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/patio_covers_large.jpg?v=1597853849" alt=""></a><br><br>There are a few things to keep in mind with covers. <br><br>1.) <strong>DO NOT</strong> use your cover on damp or wet furniture. If you cover your item when it's damp its a recipe for mold and mildew and defeats the purpose of trying to protect your furniture.<br><br>2.) <strong>DO</strong> use it when you will be away from home. We all know weather is unpredictable and if you will be away from your home its best to put your cover on just in case that sunny forecast turns to showers <br><br>3.) <strong>DO NOT</strong> store anything on top of your covered items. If you place anything heavy on top of your set and it rains this can cause moisture marks and stains that the cover cannot prevent. So keep those planters or lawn games or whatever it may be elsewhere. <br>. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MATERIALS</strong> </span><br><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/Materials_large.jpg?v=1597853842" alt="" width="305" height="208"><br>Now we know all materials are not the same. Wood is different than metal and wicker and they all need to be treated differently to keep them looking as fresh as possible. Here are our best tips for keeping your patio furniture looking top-notch. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RESIN WICKER RATTAN:</strong></span><br><br>Resin wicker rattan is one of the most common patio materials and can be vacuumed with a brush attachment and spot-cleaned with a sponge or toothbrush, dish soap (pH neutral), and water. But if your resin wicker gets really dirty, or it's full of dust after the offseason, you can give it a deep cleaning by hosing it down. If necessary, rinse it with a hose, then SOFTLY scrub it with a soft brush and soapy water, then rinse again with the hose. Let with wicker dry completely before using the furniture, need we remind you about that pesky mildew. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WOODEN PATIO FURNITURE:</strong></span><br><br>The general cleaning instructions for wood furniture are pretty simple: wipe away dirt using a damp, non-abrasive cloth. For stubborn spots, simply dip a cloth into a mix of gentle, pH-neutral soap and warm water. Wring out the excess liquid and wipe the spot. Then, dry the area with a separate cloth or, if it’s a nice day, let the sun work its magic. <br><br>If you are lucky enough to have a pool or hot tub make sure your clean down your wood furniture more often as the chemicals from chlorine can impact the wood. Rule of thumb, wash it down once a week to be on the safe side. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>METAL PATIO FURNITURE:</strong></span><br><br>What do you think about when you hear metal and storage? Rust! No one wants rusty patio furniture and that why our metal pieces are made with powder-coated and galvanized metal materials to help keep that rust far away. Cleaning steel and aluminum requires a delicate hand. When it comes time to clean your metal pieces a rag and some warm, soapy water does the trick. Just a light wipe will do. Be sure to rinse the metal thoroughly and pat it dry so you are free of any stains and discoloration.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/accessories">CUSHIONS</a>:</strong></span><br><br>From kids to pets to klutzy guests, your patio cushions go through a lot. Luckily they are made for this! <br><br>Regular Care: Give your patio cushions a dust down regularly, you don't want the dirt, twigs, bugs, or whatever else building up. If it's been an especially windy or rainy week and you need to do a bit more than just a dust down, then pull in the reinforcements and grab that vacuum cleaner and add the brush attachment for even more in-depth cleaning! <br><br>Spot Cleaning: If some guests got overexcited, or that wasp wouldn't get out of their face and you have somehow found a blob of wine on your patio set trust the old classic advice of our elders. Dab do NOT rub with a damp clean cloth. If it's a real doozy mix some water with pH-neutral soap and spray it on the stain. And if it's a complete write-off and the culprit is offering to buy you a new cushion, click here to see our replacement cushions. <br><br>Finally, a quick word about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/umbrellas">PATIO UMBRELLAS</a>;</strong></span><br><br>The general rule of thumb when your umbrella is not in use is pretty simple, keep your patio umbrella closed, and store it in a cool, dry place. <br><br>If you're looking for some in-depth Umbrella storage knowledge <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blogs/news/caring-for-your-umbrella">click here </a>and read our dedicated Patio Umbrella care blog.</p>]]>

<h3>1. Strategically Place Tall Potted Plants</h3>
<p>In a tall room, adding tall or voluminous plants can help take up empty corners, spaces, or fill vertical space. Just be sure that any plant you add to your home gets enough light to survive. Dead plants do not make a living room – or any room – cozy!</p>

<h3>2. Paint Your Walls Two-Toned</h3>
<p>In a large room, painting until several inches from the ceiling can make your room feel a bit smaller and cozier, in the same way that painting a few inches onto your ceiling can make the room feel much larger.</p>

<h3>3. Trade Coffee Tables for Oversized Ottomans</h3>
<p>A soft, plush <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/ottomans-benches">ottoman</a> is a perfect way to make your living room feel cozy and warm. They’re great to rest your feet on, and with the addition of a tray, can serve perfectly as a coffee table as well. <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/ottomans-benches">Ottomans</a> are also available with <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/ottomans-benches/type_storage">storage</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Use Console Tables to Define Separate Spaces</h3>
<p>Console <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/tables">tables </a>are an incredibly versatile piece of furniture. Whether pushed up against a wall or against a sofa, these can act as easy barriers to separate different areas of an open-concept living area or to separate seating arrangements.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27146 size-large" title="A simple wooden console table provides storage and creates a barrier between the seating area and the open space around it. Moving furniture away from the walls creates a much more intimate seating area." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140830/cozy-living-room-tip-4-Garrison-Hullinger-StoneHenge-870x565.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140830/cozy-living-room-tip-4-Garrison-Hullinger-StoneHenge.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140830/cozy-living-room-tip-4-Garrison-Hullinger-StoneHenge-300x195.jpeg 300w" alt="A simple wooden console table provides storage and creates a barrier between the seating area and the open space around it.

<h3>5. Fill A Large Living Room With A Large Sectional</h3>
<p>A cavernous living room needs furniture to match. A lengthy <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/sofas-loveseats/style_sectional">sectional sofa</a> is a cozy, comfortable way to make a large living room feel more intimate, warm, and inviting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27147 size-large" title="This metallic blue sofa might be in a cool color, but the sheer size makes it perfect for filling this enormous space. Note that the furniture is pushed away from the walls, and plants are used to fill open space between the back of the sofa and the wall." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140831/cozy-living-room-tip-5-zillow-870x580.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140831/cozy-living-room-tip-5-zillow-870x580.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140831/cozy-living-room-tip-5-zillow-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140831/cozy-living-room-tip-5-zillow.jpeg 1024w" alt="This metallic blue sofa might be in a cool color, but the sheer size makes it perfect for filling this enormous space.

<h3>6. Natural Light</h3>
<p>The amount of natural light filtering into your <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/pages/living">living room</a> can’t be understated when it comes to how inviting your living room is. Dark living rooms are uninviting and can feel depressing and small. A cozy living room is not a living room that feels small. If you can, keep your windows as uncovered as possible to let natural light in.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27148 size-large" title="Seamless sliding doors in addition to a set of windows at the top of the ceiling ensure that this living room gets plenty of light." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140832/cozy-living-room-tip-6-Wnuk-Spurlock-InOut-870x640.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140832/cozy-living-room-tip-6-Wnuk-Spurlock-InOut.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140832/cozy-living-room-tip-6-Wnuk-Spurlock-InOut-300x221.jpeg 300w" alt="Seamless sliding doors in addition to a set of windows at the top of the ceiling ensure that this living room gets plenty of light." width="870" height="640"></p>

<h3>7. Create an Intimate Space Just for Two</h3>
<p>If your large living room just doesn’t seem to host many guests, you might decide to make it feel cozier by adding more intimate seating arrangements. At parties, guests tend to break down into smaller groups.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27149 size-large" title="This living room features three intimate spaces that are perfect for groups of two, including a set of wing-back chairs, a loveseat, and a chaise with a back on either side." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140834/cozy-living-room-tip-7-Zillow-870x579.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140834/cozy-living-room-tip-7-Zillow-870x579.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140834/cozy-living-room-tip-7-Zillow-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140834/cozy-living-room-tip-7-Zillow.jpeg 1024w" alt="This living room features three intimate spaces that are perfect for groups of two, including a set of wing-back chairs, a loveseat, and a chaise with a back on either side." width="870" height="579"></p>

<h3>8. Add a Few Throw Blankets</h3>
<p>A throw blanket here and there adds texture, color, and yes, warmth. Having a blanket nearby instantly makes your guests feel more at home. And who doesn’t love having a blanket on hand to curl up with when it gets a little chilly?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27150 size-large" title="These blankets serve a double purpose: they add a bright pop of color, while also making guests feel more at home." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140836/cozy-living-room-tip-8-Garrison-Hullinger-American-Spirit-870x580.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140836/cozy-living-room-tip-8-Garrison-Hullinger-American-Spirit.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140836/cozy-living-room-tip-8-Garrison-Hullinger-American-Spirit-300x200.jpeg 300w" alt="These blankets serve a double purpose: they add a bright pop of color, while also making guests feel more at home." width="870" height="580"></p>

<h3>9. Create Seating Groups</h3>
<p>In lengthy living rooms, create more intimate seating groups with chairs and love seats. You won’t notice how large the room is if you aren’t looking at all the empty seating!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27152 size-large" title="This enormous living room is separated by a single wide archway, which makes it easy to separate the rooms into two distinct seating areas." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140838/cozy-living-room-tip-9-Roselind-Wilson-Easton-Square-870x580.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140838/cozy-living-room-tip-9-Roselind-Wilson-Easton-Square.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140838/cozy-living-room-tip-9-Roselind-Wilson-Easton-Square-300x200.jpeg 300w" alt="This enormous living room is separated by a single wide archway, which makes it easy to separate the rooms into two distinct seating areas." width="870" height="580"></p>

<h3>10. Add Bookshelves and Books</h3>
<p>There’s something comforting about books. Bookshelves take up a large amount of wall space, so they’re easy to add to a living room where the furniture is pushed away from the walls.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27154 size-large" title="The built-in bookshelves are filled to the brim with the owner's library.

<h3>11. Add Personal or Family Photos</h3>
<p>There’s nothing like adding family photos to make your living room feel inviting and warm. Adding these pictures make your living room feel more like it’s  yours, which is exactly why you’re told to remove family photos when you are staging your home to sell.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27156 size-large" title="The built-in shelves on either side of the fireplace are filled with books and family photos, with a photograph above the mantle as well." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140844/cozy-living-room-tip-11-GHID-Rivington-870x579.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140844/cozy-living-room-tip-11-GHID-Rivington.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140844/cozy-living-room-tip-11-GHID-Rivington-300x200.jpeg 300w" alt="The built-in shelves on either side of the fireplace are filled with books and family photos, with a photograph above the mantle as well." width="870" height="579"></p>

<h3>12. Utilize Floor and Table Lamps</h3>
<p>For the evening hours, there’s nothing better than a lamp to add an inviting warm glow to your living room space. When it’s time to close the shades so that your neighbors can’t see into your home, lamps keep your space well-lit.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27157 size-large" title="A combination of floor and table lamps ensures that each seating area has plenty of light for reading or conversing." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140845/cozy-living-room-tip-12-870x580.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140845/cozy-living-room-tip-12-870x580.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140845/cozy-living-room-tip-12-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140845/cozy-living-room-tip-12.jpeg 1000w" alt="A combination of floor and table lamps ensures that each seating area has plenty of light for reading or conversing." width="870" height="580"></p>

<h3>13. Expand Your Curtains Floor to Ceiling</h3>
<p>Floor to ceiling curtains are an excellent way to add warm colors to your design, and also lengthen a small room, making it feel larger.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27158 size-large" title="Multi-colored curtains add warmth to the light color pallet, and lengthen the walls." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140846/cozy-living-room-tip-13-870x579.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140846/cozy-living-room-tip-13-870x579.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140846/cozy-living-room-tip-13-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140846/cozy-living-room-tip-13.jpeg 1000w" alt="Multi-colored curtains add warmth to the light color pallet, and lengthen the walls." width="870" height="579"></p>

<h3>14. Personalize with Your Favorite Accents and Knick-Knacks</h3>
<p>Pick your favorite pieces from your collection and arrange them on your shelves to add your personality and warmth to the living room. A living room that feels like yours is a cozy living room.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27159 size-large" title="Exotic sculptures and artwork are displayed on the mantle and shelves surrounding this fireplace and entertainment center." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140848/cozy-living-room-tip-14-870x667.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140848/cozy-living-room-tip-14-870x667.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140848/cozy-living-room-tip-14-300x230.jpeg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140848/cozy-living-room-tip-14.jpeg 1000w" alt="Exotic sculptures and artwork are displayed on the mantle and shelves surrounding this fireplace and entertainment center." width="870" height="667"></p>

<h3>15. Warm Up with an Area Rug</h3>
<p>Tile or wooden floors are popular in contemporary and modern design, but you can’t beat an area rug to warm up a cool floor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27160 size-large" title="If you want to add texture, go for a plusher rug. For color or visual interest, go with a patterned rug." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140849/cozy-living-room-tip-15-870x579.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140849/cozy-living-room-tip-15-870x579.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140849/cozy-living-room-tip-15-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140849/cozy-living-room-tip-15.jpeg 1000w" alt="If you want to add texture, go for a plusher rug.

<h3>16. Add Warmer Tones to Your Color Pallet</h3>
<p>Add colors with a warmer undertone to your living room to make your living room feel more inviting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27161 size-full" title="While taupe is still a cooler color, it brings out the warmth in the brick fireplace and in the wood floor, warming the room." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140850/cozy-living-room-tip-16-Linda-McDougald-Palmetto.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140850/cozy-living-room-tip-16-Linda-McDougald-Palmetto.jpeg 600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140850/cozy-living-room-tip-16-Linda-McDougald-Palmetto-300x201.jpeg 300w" alt="While taupe is still a cooler color, it brings out the warmth in the brick fireplace and in the wood floor, warming the room." width="600" height="401"></p>

<h3>17. Layer with Comfy, Bright Pillows</h3>
<p>To add color and warmth to a leather sofa, add brightly colored or patterned pillows–and add a lot of them! Make sure they’re super plush as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27162 size-large" title="This smaller living room seems a little small, and the bright pillows layered on the sofa add much needed color." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140851/cozy-living-room-tip-17-ARS-Idea-Country-870x653.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140851/cozy-living-room-tip-17-ARS-Idea-Country.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140851/cozy-living-room-tip-17-ARS-Idea-Country-300x225.jpeg 300w" alt="This smaller living room seems a little small, and the bright pillows layered on the sofa add much needed color." width="870" height="653"></p>

<h3>18. Add Something Quirky and Unexpected</h3>
<p>Use odd pieces of furniture as accents to add personality to your living room. You won’t believe how welcoming they’ll make your living room feel!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27164 size-large" title="A few unique pieces, including a hunting trophy, cuckoo clock, and an old gas pump, are unexpected additions to this rustic-contemporary living room." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140854/cozy-living-room-tip-18-870x580.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140854/cozy-living-room-tip-18-870x580.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140854/cozy-living-room-tip-18-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140854/cozy-living-room-tip-18.jpeg 1000w" alt="A few unique pieces, including a hunting trophy, cuckoo clock, and an old gas pump, are unexpected additions to this rustic-contemporary living room." width="870" height="580"></p>
<p>A few unique pieces, including a hunting trophy, cuckoo clock, and an old gas pump, are unexpected additions to this rustic-contemporary living room.</p>
<h3>19. Add Bold Artwork</h3>
<p>Don’t be afraid to add art to your design, or even to let it take over! A single sculpture or painting can become the focal piece of a warm, inviting living room.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27165 size-large" title="An enormous print takes up almost an entire wall, drawing attention from the solid charcoal gray sectional sofa. Light greens add a pop of color." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140856/cozy-living-room-tip-19-Turnbull-Griffin-Haesloop-Hupomone-870x580.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140856/cozy-living-room-tip-19-Turnbull-Griffin-Haesloop-Hupomone.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140856/cozy-living-room-tip-19-Turnbull-Griffin-Haesloop-Hupomone-300x200.jpeg 300w" alt="An enormous print takes up almost an entire wall, drawing attention from the solid charcoal gray sectional sofa.

<h3>20. Layer Materials and Patterns</h3>
<p>Choose complementary patterns and materials to create a visually interesting living room that keeps your eye moving, always discovering something new to focus on.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27166 size-large" title="Brick is next to a rich gray wall with a subtle painted stencil. Small, low profile pieces of furniture are layered with patterned pillows." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140857/cozy-living-room-tip-20-Modern-Design-Mid-Century-870x580.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140857/cozy-living-room-tip-20-Modern-Design-Mid-Century.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140857/cozy-living-room-tip-20-Modern-Design-Mid-Century-300x200.jpeg 300w" alt="Brick is next to a rich gray wall with a subtle painted stencil.

<h3>21. Stunning Pops of Accent Colors</h3>
<p>An incredible pop of color can make a tall living room feel much more intimate, drawing the eye down and keeping it there with bold color.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27167 size-large" title="Bright sunshine yellow and berry purple pillows accent the enormous beige sectional sofa, along with a matching textured area rug." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140858/cozy-living-room-tip-21-McLeod-Bovell-Groveland-870x580.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140858/cozy-living-room-tip-21-McLeod-Bovell-Groveland.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140858/cozy-living-room-tip-21-McLeod-Bovell-Groveland-300x200.jpeg 300w" alt="Bright sunshine yellow and berry purple pillows accent the enormous beige sectional sofa, along with a matching textured area rug." width="870" height="580"></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27168 size-large" title="The accent colors are used a little more subtly in this living room, which features bright yellow at the top of the room and royal purple near the floor." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140900/cozy-living-room-tip-21-870x577.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140900/cozy-living-room-tip-21-870x577.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140900/cozy-living-room-tip-21-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140900/cozy-living-room-tip-21.jpeg 1000w" alt="The accent colors are used a little more subtly in this living room, which features bright yellow at the top of the room and royal purple near the floor." width="870" height="577"></p>
<p>The accent colors are used a little more subtly in this living room, which features bright yellow at the top of the room and royal purple near the floor.</p>
<h3>22. Make Use of Wall Space</h3>
<p>A blank wall is a wasted opportunity. Group art, photographs, or other items to display on an accent wall.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27169 size-large" title="This light lavender accent wall is filled with an array of prints and artwork that take up nearly the whole wall." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140901/cozy-living-room-tip-22-Ippolito-Fleitz-Quant-10-870x652.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140901/cozy-living-room-tip-22-Ippolito-Fleitz-Quant-10.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140901/cozy-living-room-tip-22-Ippolito-Fleitz-Quant-10-300x225.jpeg 300w" alt="This light lavender accent wall is filled with an array of prints and artwork that take up nearly the whole wall." width="870" height="652"></p>

<h3>23. Decorate with Flowers</h3>
<p>Floral arrangements are always a great way to add warmth and life to a living room, but like houseplants, you’ll need to make sure they get plenty of sunlight and love.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27170 size-full" title="Floral arrangements bring richer, more lively colors to this soft beige beach home's living room." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140902/cozy-living-room-tip-23-Emily-Gilbert-Beach-homes.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140902/cozy-living-room-tip-23-Emily-Gilbert-Beach-homes.jpeg 811w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140902/cozy-living-room-tip-23-Emily-Gilbert-Beach-homes-282x300.jpeg 282w" alt="Floral arrangements bring richer, more lively colors to this soft beige beach home's living room." width="811" height="864"></p>

<h3>24. Don’t Leave Your Mantle Bare</h3>
<p>Decorate your mantle! The key is to add complementary, interesting display pieces so that your living room feels homey and inviting, rather than open and empty.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27171 size-large" title="A few quaint details on the mantle reflect the home's design scheme and the owner's personality." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140903/cozy-living-room-tip-24-870x527.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140903/cozy-living-room-tip-24-870x527.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140903/cozy-living-room-tip-24-300x182.jpeg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140903/cozy-living-room-tip-24.jpeg 1000w" alt="A few quaint details on the mantle reflect the home's design scheme and the owner's personality." width="870" height="527"></p>
<p>A few quaint details on the mantle reflect the home’s design scheme and the owner’s personality.</p>
<h3>25. Group Like Items Together</h3>
<p>When adding accents to a room, keep items with a similar shape or theme together to keep your living room feeling balanced and interesting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27172 size-large" title="There's a lot going on in this living room, but each area has items grouped together that match in some way, color, shape, material, or size." src="https://d31eqxppr3nlos.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140905/cozy-living-room-tip-25-GHID-Danish-Lux-870x571.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140905/cozy-living-room-tip-25-GHID-Danish-Lux.jpeg 870w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/homestratosphere/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/07140905/cozy-living-room-tip-25-GHID-Danish-Lux-300x197.jpeg 300w" alt="There's a lot going on in this living room, but each area has items grouped together that match in some way, color, shape, material, or size." width="870" height="571"></p>

<p><strong>The Basics of Daylight Saving</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spring forward:</strong><span> </span>Each year on a predetermined date in March (For those states where Daylight saving applies), the clock “springs forward” one hour at 2:00AM. Good news – The days are longer and brighter – no more getting out of work at 5pm to an almost pitch black sky! Let the outdoor patio eating commence!</p>
<p><strong>Fall back:</strong><span> </span>On a predetermined date in November, the clock “falls back” one hour at 2:00AM (making it 1:00AM). This allows for more light in the morning, but unfortunately makes it darker much sooner in the evenings.</p>
<p>Now that we have the basics out of the way, here are a few transitions you can make in your home when daylight saving time comes around!</p>

<br><strong>Replace Batteries:</strong><span> Smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors are incredibly important, but their upkeep is easily neglected in the craziness of our everyday busy lives. Use daylight saving time as a calendar reminder to test the devices and replace the batteries in these life-saving devices.</span><br>

<br><strong>Make a Fall/Spring Cleaning Rule:</strong><br><a href="https://www.homes.com/blog/2016/04/the-ultimate-spring-cleaning-round-up-2/">Spring cleaning</a><span> is important to keeping your house clutter-free and helping with that pesky pack rat habit you may have. Use the bi-annual daylight saving time change as a cue to implement some spring/fall cleaning. Go through your clothes and give away items you haven’t worn in a year by donating to Goodwill or other local organizations.</span>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Heating and Cooling System Checks:</strong><span> </span>Maintenance is absolutely key for responsible home ownership. Anyone who has had to replace an HVAC system knows it can cost upward of $10,000 for a brand new system. Proper maintenance can help lengthen the life of your system and avoid expensive repairs. When the time changes, have your HVAC looked at by a professional to save you expensive heartache in the long hall.</p>
<p><strong>Flip your mattress:</strong><span> </span>Mattresses should flipped several times a year (or turned if it cannot be flipped) to make sure the weight is being evenly distributed throughout the mattress. This will extend the life of your <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/mattresses-box-spring/type_mattress">mattress</a>. While you are flipping the mattress, take the sheets off and vacuum the top and sides of the mattress. You sleep on it every night, so don’t neglect your mattress!</p>

<br><strong>Don’t forget to change clocks!</strong><span> This seems like an obvious one, but being one hour off can really throw a wrench in your day! While most of our clocks are electronic and change automatically, changing your manual or battery operated clocks is key for not interrupting your routine and schedule!</span>
<p> </p>
<p>Daylight saving time can be a great way to remind us to do other important tasks around the house, and not just checking the time!</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you’ve chosen your decorating theme (or have chosen to just do a little bit of decorating), it’s time to choose a color palette. Though it may feel like an unnecessary step, having a simple color palette in place can help you make the right purchases when shopping for decor and accessories.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Choosing color for seasonal decorating is easy because you don’t have to limit yourself to just a few colors. You’ll want to choose three main colors for your decorating plan, then add three accent colors to your palette. There are no must-not-break rules for choosing color for your Thanksgiving decor — just<span> </span>choose the colors<span> </span>that express the vibe you’d like for your home.</span></p>

    <title>Caring for your Umbrella</title>
    <author>
      <name>Aaron Prior</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>Patio umbrellas (whether used with a table or free-standing) provide ample shade on sunny days. You can stay cool by the pool or comfortable during a barbecue with a variety of umbrella styles. While patio umbrellas are designed to be durable, withstanding ultraviolet rays and rain, their construction contains many mechanisms that should looked after. Fortunately, keeping your umbrella in like-new condition is easy. Here are some tips for cleaning and caring for your patio-shading umbrellas:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Wash the Frame</u></strong></p>
<p>You won’t have to clean your patio umbrella frame often, but periodic and as-needed treatment will support a long product life. Whether you want to remove dust and debris or wipe off a mark, all you need is a clean, damp cloth. Rub down the frame thoroughly. This should take care of most dirt. However, if you have a more stubborn mark, start with a mixture of mild soap and water, and administer it with a gentle cloth. Once you’ve scrubbed off the mark, rinse with the damp cloth.</p>
<p>Avoid using toxic cleaners or harsh chemicals, as these products may damage or rust your umbrella frame finish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Clean the fabric</u></strong></p>
<p>From bird droppings to fallen leaves, your patio umbrella fabric can collect some unsavory debris. Washing those items off right away helps prevent stains, so act quickly. Start by checking to see if your umbrella fabric is detachable, which will make cleaning easier. Next, lay down a tarp or some blankets on your yard to protect your umbrella from touching the ground and place the canopy fabric on top. Spray the affected area with your garden hose, then scrub any marks using a gentle cloth, mild soap and warm water. Finally, rinse the area again using your hose. Often, you’ll notice the water beading on the fabric – this is the result of the fabric’s construction, which is designed to repel rainwater.</p>
<p>Let your umbrella air dry. Leave the umbrella open, and if possible, put it in a sunny spot to speed up the drying process.</p>
<p>Patio umbrella fabric is designed to resist fade caused by sunlight.</p>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/PPU-411-U_detail1_RGB_large.jpg?v=1566514433" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><strong><u>Remove stains</u></strong></p>
<p>If stains do set into the fabric, you still have some options. To get rid of tough stains, Sunbrella® (which manufactures many umbrella fabrics) recommends using a combination of 1 cup of bleach and 1/4 cup of mild soap for every gallon of water. Work the cleaner into the stain and allow it to sit for 15 minutes. Then, use a mild scrub brush to whisk the mark away. Again, let the umbrella air dry. Remember, this process is only for tough, set-in stains.</p>
<p>It’s important to always follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for your specific umbrella fabric.</p>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/PPU-460-U_env1_large.jpg?v=1566514530" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><strong><u>Maintain the base</u></strong></p>
<p>Your umbrella will stand upright thanks the support of a base. Here are some simple steps for maintaining a resin, water-filled umbrella base:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empty it of standing water periodically</li>
<li>Always remove the water before winter arrives – otherwise it will freeze, expand and potentially crack the base</li>
<li>Use a garden hose to wash off debris</li>
<li>Mild soap and water can also be used to clean marks</li>
<li>Avoid standing on the base – it’s only meant to support the weight of the umbrella</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/PPU-903-U_env1_large.jpg?v=1566514611" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>For umbrella bases made from materials like cast iron or steel, scrub clean using a mixture of mild dishwasher detergent and warm water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Wrap Things Up</u></strong></p>
<p>Once everything is clean and dry you can close the umbrella. Just like furniture often comes with outdoor furniture covers, cantilever umbrellas sometimes have covers of their own. If your cantilever umbrella has a cover specifically fitted for it, then tightly secure it in the cover. If, for whatever reason, it does not have a cover, tightly wrap the umbrella in a large sheet of plastic such as a paint drop cloth. The plastic should be larger than the umbrella. Once the cover is secure, tape the sides to keep it in place. The plastic will help protect fabric from mold and mildew over the winter as well as keep the arms of the umbrella in place. Snagging even one section on an object could bend or break your patio umbrella.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Storage</u></strong></p>
<p>Find a location that is dry through the winter months such as a secure garage, basement, or attic. Be sure to avoid areas where dampness and wet weather might creep in without your knowing it. You want to be sure that your umbrella is ready to cover your outdoor furniture and yourself come spring, so store laying down or standing up away from other objects that might bend, misshape, or cause damage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With these straightforward maintenance tips, you’ll keep your patio umbrellas in great, shade-providing condition.</p>

    <title>Protect Patio Furniture throughout Winter</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>During the warmer months, your <a href="https://www.hayneedle.com/outdoor/furniture_183815">outdoor patio furniture</a> likely gets a lot of use. In colder months, you probably spend less time outside and thus less time utilizing your outdoor furniture. If you live in an area that has a cold or wet climate in the winter, you will need to take steps to make sure that your patio furniture is properly protected from the elements.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cleaning</u></strong></p>
<p>Ensuring that your furniture set is clean before it is stored can help prevent staining and corrosion while making it possible to pull out your furniture to enjoy those first warm days once spring arrives.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning Wicker Sets:<em> </em></strong>Wicker sets can be made of true rattan or synthetic rattan. Often, the wicker is sealed with some sort of finish to protect the material. Using a mild soap with warm water and gentle scrub brush or sponge, clean the surface of your furniture. Allow the furniture to air dry completely, or use a towel to dry. Address any areas that need repair or repainting while the set is clean and dry.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/PCL_large.jpg?v=1566514051" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><strong>Cleaning Metal Sets:<em> </em></strong>Most metal sets are sealed with a powder coat finish to ensure a longer life. Using a mild soap with warm water and gentle scrub brush or sponge, clean the surface of your furniture. Allow the furniture to air dry completely, or use a towel to dry. Address any areas that need repair or repainting while the set is clean and dry.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning Wood Sets:<em> </em></strong>Wood sets can vary, from a classic picnic table to a set of Adirondack Chairs. Using a mild soap with warm water and gentle scrub brush or sponge, clean the surface of your furniture. Allow the furniture to air dry completely, or use a towel to dry. Address any areas that require sanding, painting, or staining. If the wood has a natural finish, consider rubbing a furniture oil or mineral oil into the surface to keep the wood from splitting or becoming brittle during dry winter months.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/PEX_large.jpg?v=1566514026" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><strong>Cleaning Cushions:<em> </em></strong>Many deep seating patio furniture sets include substantial cushioning, while other sets are accented with optional cushions or pillows. Brush off any debris on cushions. If cushions and pillows have removable covers, wash and dry them according to manufacturer instructions. If cushion covers cannot be removed, use mild soapy water and a sponge to wipe off any dirt on cushions. Let the cushions and pillows dry completely before storing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Covering/Wrapping Your Patio Furniture</u></strong></p>
<p>There are a number of options available for the covering or wrapping of your patio furniture sets. Ideally, it would be nice to move your furniture into a garage, shed, or basement where it is dry and sheltered. However, there are very few people that have the extra space available to store bulky items like patio furniture. If this is the case for you, there are still great methods for protecting your furniture if it must stay outdoors during the winter months.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/Cover_large.jpg?v=1566513962" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Once you have cleaned and dried your furniture and accessories, try to consolidate the pieces to minimize the space that will be required for storing everything. Stack chairs, remove cushions, and dismantle any components that might be susceptible to damage. Select a storage location that is as sheltered from the elements as possible. If feasible, bring your fabric items inside for the winter, or consider putting them in a sealed tote or plastic bag for dry storage. There are a number of commercial patio furniture covers available on the market for a variety of patio furniture types. These covers are usually made from heavy duty canvas that is sealed to keep out moisture and protect from damage. Other options could include having your set professionally wrapped in plastic film or simply using a large tarp that can be secured with rope or bungee cords.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Store It</u></strong></p>
<p>Storing your outdoor furniture during seasons where it won’t get regular use is the best way to protect it from winter’s harsh conditions. There are several places you can store your outdoor furniture during the winter months, like a garage, basement, or storage shed. Even if you have some extra space under your deck or on a covered patio, this shelter will help keep your outdoor furniture clear of standing snow, water, and ice. An alternative option to storing your outdoor furnishings away for the winter months is to bring outdoor pieces indoors to use and enjoy during the colder seasons.</p>
<p>Smaller items like cushions, pillows, and other outdoor decor don’t require nearly as much storage space as larger furniture pieces do, and as such they can be easily stowed away in an outdoor storage box.</p>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/5070/4499/files/Shed_large.jpg?v=1566513887" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p><strong><u>Successful Storage Through the Winter</u></strong></p>
<p>If you have followed the cleaning and covering steps outlined previously, you can probably feel comfortable knowing that your patio furniture will be safely cocooned for the winter months to come. On occasion, it can be helpful to brush any accumulated ice or snow from your furniture coverings to prevent any leaking or shifting that could allow moisture to infiltrate and damage the furniture. It might also be a good idea to check every once in a while for any critters that might have decided that your securely covered furniture set would be a perfect home for the winter.</p>
<p>While it may be time to trade your flip flops and sunscreen for wool socks and hot cocoa, you can look forward to a successful transition into summer next year with patio furniture that has been carefully stored.</p>

    <title>Big Style, Small Spaces: Home Work</title>

      <![CDATA[<h3>Make sure your home office is efficient but also reflects your personality</h3>
<p>Working from home has lots of advantages – the office commute is about 30 seconds, you can stick a load of laundry in between conference calls, and you can wear PJs for most of the day. The downside is you’re too close to it to get away, you don’t want to be doing laundry all day, and PJs are really a fashion crime. Whether you work for yourself, or for a company that allows for some work from<span> home</span>, you still need a proper office. To start with, plan by making a list of everything you need in order to work well — natural light, tons of storage space and miles of counter-top.</p>
<p>Where you work is important — preferably a dedicated office space in the guest bedroom, a main floor den, or the basement. This also depends on the kind of work you do; clients dropping in need a place to sit. Laptops and WiFi make it easy to move your office around, even to the back deck. Once you’ve picked a spot, try a space planner to see where the furniture should go, making sure electrical outlets and phone jacks – if you still use a landline – are close to the workspace. Include space for a printer, phone and resource materials. Rarely used items can be stored in the basement or a closet.</p>
<p><b>CHAIR</b></p>
<p>You’ll be sitting in this for six to eight hours a day, so get one that adjusts to your specific ergonomics. As pretty as leather is, refrain from buying it because you need something breathable. Chairs range in price from $150 to $2,000, but you can get a decent one for about $300.</p>
<p><img src="https://myhomepage.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/big_style_small_spaces_feb2018_2.jpg" width="550" height="367"></p>
<p><b>DESK</b></p>
<p>Standard desks are 29 inches high, but 27 inches high is actually ergonomically better for where your arms and hands are while using a laptop. If the desk isn’t adjustable, raise your chair a little. You also need enough workspace to spread out papers; if one desk won’t do, add a second.</p>
<p>A writing desk is preferable to those clunky mid-century office desks – much lighter and easier to move around. Place your desk so you have a view of the room and away from the outdoors. Remember to place it so that light falls over your shoulder.</p>
<p><img src="https://myhomepage.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/big_style_small_spaces_feb2018_3.jpg" width="375" height="500"></p>
<p><b>STORAGE</b></p>
<p>Drawers in the desk – or in stackable containers on top – are good for having stationery, paper clips, pens, pencils and staplers close at hand. Wallmounted storage minimizes physical and visual clutter.</p>
<p>Wherever you keep your files – on the computer, or an external hard drive, or in file folders – make a habit of culling regularly. If you haven’t used something in a year, toss it. (Except taxes. Those you need to keep for seven years.)</p>
<p><b>LIGHTING</b></p>
<p>Natural light is best, especially since windows also provide good ventilation. But if that’s not possible, bump up the overhead and task lighting and add a reading lamp. If there’s no room on the desk, have it wall mounted.</p>
<p><img src="https://myhomepage.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/big_style_small_spaces_feb2018_4.jpg" width="550" height="367"></p>
<p><b>DECORATE</b></p>
<p>If your home office is visible from the rest of the main floor, try to tie it in decoratively so that it blends in style, colour and theme.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid of colour, or at least adding colourful accessories. I love white space, but I still like to add colour through<span> accessories</span><span> </span>– a Navajo blanket, or beautiful pillows on a chair. Incorporate colour as well into stationery, magazine racks, storage containers and so on. Colour affects the way you feel; orange is considered a colour that stimulates creativity, green is restful, blue is calming and yellow makes you happy.</p>
<p>This isn’t the corporate office, it’s your home, so get creative in making it yours, and making a place you look forward to working in. Incorporate art, lamps and accessories that convey your personality. Use what you have – turn a vase into a pen holder, wicker baskets for scrap paper, the dining sideboard for printer, phone and other supplies. Splurge on a chaise – go modern with Eames or Mies, or traditional like a fainting couch — for naps and reading breaks.</p>
<p><b>SCHEDULE</b></p>
<p>When you work alone, getting down to work can sometimes be hard; it’s far easier to check out the fridge, stare into space, or run the vacuum through the main floor. Most successful people say that having a consistent routine, one that triggers the brain to get into think mode, is the only way to get things accomplished.</p>

    <title>Organize Your Home In a Month In Less Than an Hour a Day</title>
    <author>

      <![CDATA[<p>Did you ever notice that your self-improvement pacts with yourself are action oriented? Walk 10,000 steps a day. Fix that leaky faucet. Register for VolunteerMatch.</p>
<p>But “get organized”? It’s a goal so broad that just trying to figure out what action to take makes you wonder what you were thinking in the first place. It’s like you need an organizing plan for your<span> organizing</span>.</p>
<p><em>Ta da!</em></p>
<p>Here it is. Follow these steps, spending less than an hour day (sometimes just a few moments), to a<span> better organized home</span>:</p>
<a name="section-3445" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>1. Do That Project</h2>
<span></span>
<p>“What about your space is making you feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed?” asks Amy Trager, a professional organizer in Chicago. Is it the paperwork disaster in your office? The pile of clothes teetering on your dresser? Or that mess that surrounds your doorway? Start with what’s annoying you, she says. One hour on that task will get your organizing engine revving.</p>
<a name="section-3446" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>2. Create a "Go Away" Box</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Put anything you’re planning to donate in it (or give to a friend, or take to recycle). And keep it by the door so you can easily grab it when you’re leaving.</p>
<a name="section-3447" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>3. Deal With the Decorations</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Hallelujah — the holidays are over! When you’re putting away your <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blogs/news/autumn-decor-made-easy">décor</a>, donate anything you didn’t bring out last season, and separate decorations by holiday. No need to dig through your St. Patty’s clovers when you’re searching for a menorah.</p>
<a name="section-3448" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>4. Create a System for Your Entryway</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Set up a “command center” so your front door doesn’t become a lawless accessories arena, especially during winter months. Add hooks for coats, bins for shoes, and a mail sorter if you need it. (Remember to keep a place for your “go away” box).</p>
<a name="section-3449" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>5. Wrangle Your Pet Supplies</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Minimize the time spent scrambling when your pup is desperate for a walk or eager for a meal. Hang hooks and cubbies near the door and keep leashes, kibble, bowls, and toys in one convenient spot.</p>
<a name="section-3450" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>6. Organize Your Spices</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Arrange your herbs and spices alphabetically, by cuisine, or by brand — whatever makes them easier to find when you’re in the middle of your noodle stir fry.</p>
<a name="section-3451" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>7. Pare Down Your Utensils</h2>
<span></span>
<p>You’ve accumulated several dozen kitchen utensils in your culinary career: can openers, microplanes, four (what?!) wine openers. Pare down the collection and use drawer dividers to keep the remainders in order.</p>
<a name="section-3452" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>8. Reconfigure Your Pots and Pans</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Stop digging around in your shelves for the oversized, cast-iron skillet. Donate the pots and pans you hardly use, and install cupboard organizers to help manage the rest.</p>
<a name="section-3453" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>9. Throw Away Expired Foods</h2>
<span></span>
<p>You never use Worcestershire sauce — except that<span> </span><em>one</em><span> </span>time. Go through your refrigerator and pantry and ditch or donate anything past its prime.</p>
<a name="section-3454" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>10. Stack Your Pantry Staples</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Make better use of your pantry by sorting through your staple dry goods — think flour, sugar, pasta, oatmeal, dry beans — and putting them in airtight, stackable containers. You’ll free up a ton of space, too.</p>
<a name="section-3455" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>11. Downsize Your Kitchen Gadgets</h2>
<span></span>
<p>You had noble intentions when you purchased that spiralizer. (Zucchini noodles<span> </span><em>every</em><span> </span>night, right?) Give those space hogs to someone else with lofty dreams.</p>
<a name="section-3456" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>12. Say No to Coffee Mug Over-Saturation</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Every time you lose a sock, a new coffee mug appears. Keep one or two mugs for every coffee or tea drinker, and donate the rest.</p>
<a name="section-3457" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>13. Sort Your Food Storage Containers</h2>
<span></span>
<p>No singles allowed. Toss any tops or bottoms that have no mates.</p>
<a name="section-3458" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>14. Reassess Your Display Shelves</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Shelves crammed with knickknacks, books you’ll never read, and<span> </span><em>stuff</em><span> </span>you somehow accumulated are just a waste of space. Donate books to the library, discard the junk, and arrange what’s left in a way that pleases you.</p>
<a name="section-3459" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>15. Deal With Your Cables</h2>
<span></span>
<p>With a Roku, PlayStation, DVD player, and a cable box, it’s no surprise your entertainment center is a mess. Create ID tags for each plug from bread tags or cable ties, and bundle the clutter together with velcro strips.</p>
<a name="section-3460" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>16. Put Clothes on New Hangers</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Switch your clothes over to the slimmer, grabbier hangers. They use less space and keep your clothes from sliding down to your closet floor. As you do this, discard the clothes you never wear.</p>
<a name="section-3461" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>17. Corral Your Accessories</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Belts, scarves, purses, hats — all the accessories that don’t have a drawer or spot in the closet can end up everywhere. Buy an accessories hanger or install a simple series of hooks to give your wardrobe’s smallest members a home.</p>
<a name="section-3462" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>18. Purge Under the Bed</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Under-bed storage is ideal for out-of-season clothing. But when out-of-season becomes out-of-sight and out-of-mind, clear out those clothes you’ll never wear again from this precious storage space.</p>
<a name="section-3463" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>19. Declutter Your Desk</h2>
<span></span>
<p>When your workspace is swimming with collectibles, staplers, Post-its, and more, paring down can keep you focused when it’s time to hunker down.</p>
<a name="section-3464" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>20. Shred Old Paperwork</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Not every form, statement, and tax record needs to stay in your filing cabinet forever. Check out<span> </span><a href="https://www.houselogic.com/finances-taxes/taxes/how-long-to-keep-tax-records/">this list</a><span> </span>to make sure you’re not wasting space. Shred the rest to ward off identity thieves.</p>
<a name="section-3465" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>21. Tidy Your Files</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Now that you’ve shredded the paperwork you don’t need, tidy up your files by organizing them and labeling them clearly. Colorful folders can help organize by theme (home stuff, tax stuff, work stuff, etc.).</p>
<a name="section-3490" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>22. Get Rid of Mystery Electronics</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Admit it. You’ve got a drawer where black mystery cords, chargers, and oddball electronic bits go to die. Free that drawer up for better uses, or at least get rid of the ones you know for sure are “dead.”</p>
<a name="section-3491" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>23. Pare Down Your Personal Care Stuff</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Your intentions were honorable when you bought that curl-enhancing shampoo — but it expired two years ago, and you haven’t used it since. Throw away any expired potions, salves, hair products, and medicines.</p>
<a name="section-3492" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>24. Tackle Under-the-Sink Storage</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Clean everything out. You’ll be amazed at what you find (like those Magic Erasers you could never find). Then put back everything you’re keeping in bins you can easily pull out so nothing gets lost again.</p>
<a name="section-3493" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>25. Hang a Shelf</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Wall storage is so often overlooked. Find a spot in your home where a shelf would solve a problem, and hang it. Maybe it’s for some toiletries in the bathroom, or laundry supplies, or for your kid’s stuffed toys.</p>
<a name="section-3494" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>26. Reduce Your Towels and Linens</h2>
<span></span>
<p>There are the towels you use — and the stack of towels you<span> </span><em>never</em><span> </span>use. Donate them to the animal shelter. Those torn pillowcases? Convert to rags or toss. Same for napkins, dishtowels, pot holders, etc.</p>
<a name="section-3495" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>27. Hang a Shoe Organizer</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Hanging shoe organizers can solve a ton of storage problems beyond the obvious. They can store scarves, mittens, cleaning supplies, craft supplies. You can even cut them to custom-fit inside a cabinet door.</p>
<a name="section-3496" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>28. Organize Your Junk Drawer for Good</h2>
<span></span>
<p>There’s no shame in a junk drawer — but why not organize it? Dump the whole thing on one surface and sort everything into piles. Use drawer dividers to keep each pile in its own space.</p>
<a name="section-3497" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>29. Store Your Tools the Right Way</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Finding the right Phillips-head screwdriver to put together that cute IKEA bookshelf shouldn’t be so hard. Track down your hammers and screwdrivers, and arrange them in one easy-to-access spot, such as a pegboard.</p>
<a name="section-3498" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>30. Plan for the Future</h2>
<span></span>
<p>See how much you’ve accomplished! Take a look around your newly organized home, making note of any spaces you missed. Then dream a bit about your next home project. Maybe<span> </span><span class="s1">paint that <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/dining-sets">dining room</a>, finally?</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Here’s the thing you may have noticed about houses: They don’t clean themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">A few simple daily habits could make it seem like you’ve got a self-cleaning house</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Rules like …</span></p>
<a name="section-4122" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>#1 Dedicate 20 Minutes a Day Every Day</h2>
<span></span>
<p><span class="s1">You don’t need to set aside 20 hours one day to get things in order. You only need 20 minutes <em>every</em> day.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2">Focus on <a href="https://www.houselogic.com/organize-maintain/cleaning-decluttering/clutter-free-home/"><span class="s3">tackling clutter</span></a> in just one room. You might only pare down a single drawer or shelf, but “it will make you feel accomplished at the end of the day, and at the end of a week, you will see how much you can declutter,” says professional organizer Helena Alkhas.</span></p>
<a name="section-4123" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>#2 Follow a "One-Minute" Rule</h2>
<span></span>
<p><span class="s1">Small tasks add up quickly when you’re saving them to do all at once. So if it takes less than a minute to complete, do it immediately.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Put that cup in the dishwasher rather than the sink.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Break down that Amazon box for recycling right after you unbox your goodie.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">(Hot tip: Want a reminder of how much you can get done in a minute? Next time your coffee goes cold, pop it in the microwave for a minute, <em>and just stand there. For the whole minute.</em> It’s kind of a long time.)</span></p>
<a name="section-4124" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>#3 Start a Load of Laundry Before Work</h2>
<span></span>
<p><span class="s1">If you have a full load in the hamper, toss it in while you’re getting ready for work. By the time you leave, it will be ready for the dryer.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When you get home, you’ll already feel ahead of schedule with just a little fluffing and folding to do. Just make sure you’ve <a href="https://www.houselogic.com/by-room/bathroom-laundry/how-do-i-maintain-my-washer-and-dryer/"><span class="s2">properly maintained your dryer</span></a> to reduce the risk of a fire.</span></p>
<a name="section-4125" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>#4 Always Leave a Room With Something in Hand</h2>
<p><span class="s1">Whatever room you’re in, chances are there’s a <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/collections/corliving-cares">toy</a>, cup, blanket or T-shirt that needs to be delivered back to another room.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Oh hey, conveniently, <em>you’re</em> always walking into other rooms. Why not pickup a hitchhiker or two?</span></p>
<p><span class="s2">Every time you leave a room, take a quick scan for anything that belongs where you’re going, and you’ll start habitually keeping clutter under control.</span></p>
<a name="section-4126" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>#5 Deal With Your Mail Every Time You Bring It In</h2>

<p><span class="s1">There’s a reason the Marines start the day with this simple task — also known as “wake and make.”</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">According to retired Admiral William H. McRaven, author of “Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life … and Maybe the World,” “It will give you a small sense of pride, and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another. By the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed.”</span></p>

<h2>#9 Do Chores in the Same Order</h2>
<span></span>
<p><span class="s1">Whether you’re cleaning on a Saturday or Wednesday, your mind (and body) will move more quickly from vacuuming to mopping to dusting if you check chores off in the same order — making it easier to keep your home tidy and clean.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Headphones and a throwback playlist are a recommended, but not required, part of the routine.</span></p>

<h2>#10 Spot-Clean Bathrooms Nightly</h2>
<span></span>
<p><span class="s1">Just as clutter attracts clutter, bathroom funk quickly multiplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Stock every bathroom with Lysol wipes and you can quickly and easily clean the counter-top and toilet when you brush your teeth or help the kids get ready for bed, Alkhas says.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">While wiping, you’ll naturally put away the floss, hair ties, and other clutter in your path.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Make this easy to enforce by assigning one hook and open shelf for every member of the family — double that for those with lots of extracurriculars, Alkhas says.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Don’t let moldy leftovers take over shelf space and your mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The night before your garbage day, “wipe off the shelves and clean out anything that has no chance of being eaten,” Alkhas says. You’ll get a clearer view of your food options and open up space for ingredients needed in the coming week.</span></p>
<a name="section-4134" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>#13 Empty the Dishwasher Every Morning</h2>
<span></span>
<p>The conquest of a homemade dinner (OK, a “home-prepared” dinner, most days) feels short-lived when you’re left with a mountain of dishes and no place to put them.</p>
<p><span class="s1">Take a couple minutes every morning to empty the dishwasher and you’ll stay ahead of the game.</span></p>
<a name="section-4135" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>#14 Conduct a Nightly Tidy-Up</h2>
<span></span>
<p><span class="s1">Every night, take a laundry basket on a tour of your house and pick up anything that’s out of place. “You don’t have to put it away now. If you want, plan to do it on Saturday and it won’t take much time at all,” Alkhas says.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">If there are more than two people in your household, separate the day’s clutter into assigned baskets for each family member to put away daily or weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">With this routine, Alkas adds, “you’ll wake up to a living room that’s decluttered and a kitchen that is tidy, and you can start your day fresh.”</span></p>
<a name="section-4136" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>#15 Follow a Clean-Out Schedule for Your Storage Areas</h2>
<span></span>
<p><span class="s1">Just because it’s hidden behind a cupboard door doesn’t mean it’s exempt from clutter status.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2">Establish a schedule, perhaps every month, to rid a specific storage space of its dead weight — like expired food in the pantry, excess gadgets in a kitchen drawer, or the cupboard holding the gazillion ragged dishtowels you’ve had since your tiny college studio apartment. (It’s time to let those go.)</span></p>
<a name="section-4137" class="anchor"></a>
<h2>#16 Keep Everyone Involved</h2>
<span></span>
<p><span class="s1">When one person leaves a dish in the sink, it paves a slippery slope for others to follow suit.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">So have a “The Brady Bunch”-style family meeting to make sure everyone understands their responsibilities and chores for maintaining order in the home. Serve brownies. They’ll show up.</span></p>

<p>If all else fails, consider making arrangements with a local motel or inn, and accommodate your guests there. The establishment might offer you a discount for being local or for frequent use. Your guests will be very comfortable, and the time spent out “from underfoot” will make the time together that much better.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Don’t let living small hinder your hospitality. Small spaces can lead to intimate get-togethers and great big memories.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>The words “Christmas” and “frugal” often seem mutually exclusive. While gifts and travel make up the bulk of the season’s expenses, decorating also has considerable costs. Everyone wants a festive home, whether to enjoy on their own, or to delight family and friends. It’s easy to overspend on lights and readymade decor, however, which simply adds to the financial headache of the holidays.</p>
<p>Luckily, it’s possible to cheaply transform any home into a winter wonderland. The trick is to combine creativity with the same budgetary restraint you’d use for any major purchase. Whether you want to rely on your own craftsmanship, or score decorations from unconventional sources, these Christmas decorating ideas let you <a title="" href="https://www.selflender.com/blog/how-keep-finances-good-holiday-shopping.html" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="https://www.selflender.com/blog/how-keep-finances-good-holiday-shopping.html">save money</a> at an expensive time of year.</p>
<h4>Set a Budget</h4>
<p>A primary reason that Christmas decor drains finances is neglectful budgeting. In the rush of the season, between tracking sales and planning parties, we simply fail to acknowledge the cost of decorations. Year after year, money spent on Christmas decor becomes a tidy sum. As with any major expense, you must set a budget to maximize your investment.</p>
<p>“Christmas decorations are often forgotten in the holiday budget, and before you can say ‘happy holidays,' you have spent more on lights than you did on your nephew,” says Michelle Hutchison, global money expert for <a title="" href="https://www.finder.com/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="https://www.finder.com/">Finder.com</a>. “Don’t forget to factor the decorations into the holiday budget, and don’t make exceptions.”</p>
<p>An important point to remember is that expensive decor — that inflatable Santa for the front yard, for example — only gets used for a single month. Instead of flashy, go for classic, and invest in high-quality ornaments and lights that will last for years. Also, if you keep your decorations simple, you will have more of your budget to spread around the home.</p>
<h4>Add Some Greenery</h4>
<p>The Christmas tree typically stands as the most important piece of a home’s holiday decorating scheme. Whether you have it nestled in a den or proudly displayed in the front window, your tree will likely comprise a sizable portion of your holiday budget.</p>
<p>If you want an artificial tree, keep your eyes peeled for a bargain at thrift stores and garage sales. If you prefer the natural look and live near a state park, call and inquire about any tree programs. Sometimes, state parks with an abundance of small, aggressive evergreens will allow visitors to pay a small fee to harvest one themselves.</p>
<p>Nature provides several additional ways to enliven your home for Christmas cheaply.</p>
<p>“Clipped evergreen twigs can be arranged in small cups to look like miniature trees,” says Deemer Cass of <a title="" href="http://www.fantasticgardeners.co.uk/christmas-trees-delivery-installation/?utm_expid=134531865-0.dwAhhq8lRQui9H1dvWxv3w.0" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="http://www.fantasticgardeners.co.uk/christmas-trees-delivery-installation/?utm_expid=134531865-0.dwAhhq8lRQui9H1dvWxv3w.0">Fantastic Christmas Tree Delivery</a>. “Collect them from three or four different types of trees and gather them in one place. It will give the impression of a snug little forest.”</p>
<p>A festive wreath, which can also be made from gathered branches, provides a focal point for the front of your home. To decorate a tree with natural goodness, cut fruits such as oranges, lemons, apples, and pears into thin slices, then place them in a low-temperature oven. A few hours later, you can pierce the slices and thread them with string for some festive, fragrant ornaments.</p>
<h4>Do it Yourself</h4>
<p>The do-it-yourself ethos can extend throughout your holiday decorating plans. Homemade holiday vignettes allow you to spread the cheer from room to room. To make a vignette, grab some spare ornaments, a few evergreen branches, and candles, and arrange them tastefully on top of a dresser or media stand. With a keen eye, you can likely lots of materials for decorations in everyday items around the house.</p>
<p>“Get into the festive spirit and save money through crafts,” says Michelle Hutchison. “Think Christmas wrapping recycled from funny papers and personalized stockings made from old pillow cases. An added bonus is that Christmas craft activities will keep kids entertained.”</p>
<p>For a simple centerpiece, fill a nice bowl with evergreen branches and ornaments. To make attractive and unique garlands, use sheet music. Purchase books of sheet music at a used bookstore cut the pages into strips, then staple them into loops to chain together to the desired length.</p>
<h4>Dress Up the House</h4>
<p>It’s possible to enliven your home further with subtle arrangements of everyday items. For example, candles provide a cheap and effective means to achieve a warm, holiday ambiance. Grocery stores will typically have utilitarian and religious candles for cheap; buy several and arrange them in groups throughout the home.</p>
<p>Blankets and throw pillows can also help encourage a feeling of seasonal coziness. Search your closets or browse thrift stores for items with gold, green, or red accents. You can even create a makeshift Christmas throw with a sheet of cheap plaid fabric.</p>
<p>If you have gifts, then you already have decorations. Wrap them early and place them under the tree, or distribute them creatively around the house. Framed pictures of friends and family can also serve as hangers for spare ornaments. To decorate your bedroom, cut some strands of ribbon and arrange them on pillows to create the illusion of large, fluffy “presents.”</p>
<h4>Take Care of What You Have</h4>
<p>All these budget-friendly Christmas decorating ideas mean nothing if you have to duplicate your efforts.</p>
<p>“The best way to save money on decorations, in the long run, is to properly pack and save them once the season is over,” says Annie Draddy, owner of home decor and organization service <a title="" href="http://www.henryandhigby.com/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="http://www.henryandhigby.com/">Henry &amp; Higby</a>. “Improperly wrapped lights can get knotted, wreaths crushed, and ornaments scratched or broken.”</p>
<p>If you’ve spent money on decorations, invest a few more dollars in proper storage containers. To save even more, use these containers to store goods you purchase at after-Christmas clearance sales. If you wait to buy until right after Christmas, you can typically find quality decorations at drastic discounts.</p>
<p>Going over-budget on Christmas decorations can give anyone a case of the humbugs. Budgetary considerations aside, the effort you put into these Christmas decorating ideas will also leave you with customized, singular pieces that express your originality. Decorate the right way, and you can celebrate the season without ruining your budget.</p>

Blame it on that stinky odor that only vacuums seem to emit.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="s1">Best to clean it first</span><span class="s1">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Change the bag and wipe down the bag’s holder or empty and thoroughly wash the bagless container with a soapy damp rag.</li>
<li>Wipe down the entire vacuum.</li>
<li>Pull debris from the vacuum’s brushes and wipe out the underside as much as you can.</li>
<li>Change the filter.</li>
<li>Inspect the hose for holes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This goes for your wet/dry vacuum, and handheld one, too, if you have them.</p>

<p><span class="s1">Take all your plants outside for a nice cleansing shower on a drizzly day. Then inside, tackle the spots where they live: the floor, shelf, countertop. Clean the walls and baseboards, too. And check for water damage. A cracked pot or chronic overwatering can allow moisture and dirt to leach out.</span></p>
<h2>#7 Sanitize Trash Cans</h2>
<p><span class="s1">It’s inevitable that sometimes icky stuff leaks out and crumbs make their way around the bag. But in the rush to get the new bag in there, cleaning it up often gets forgotten. And the can’s lid: Have you looked at it, really looked at it lately? Yuck.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Sanitize with a mixture of soap and bleach (don’t forget to wear gloves!) and, if your can is stowed in a cabinet, use a vacuum attachment to suck up dust and crumbs inside the cabinet box. And wash the cabinet, too. There’s almost always yucky stuff there.</span><a class="anchor" name="section-4234"></a></p>

<p><span class="s1">In our quest to clean the deepest crevices of our homes, many of us forget the stuff right under our fingertips all day long. Literally.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Light switches, door knobs, cabinet handles, and remotes are some of the germiest places in your house. You almost can’t clean them enough.</span></p>
<h2>#9 Wash Grocery Totes</h2>
<p><span class="s1">And speaking of yuck, when is the last time you cleaned your reusable grocery bags? Studies have found bacteria easily moves from your bags to your fridge, countertops, etc. — increasing the chances of food poisoning and cross-contamination.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Throw them in the washer or wash by hand with hot, soapy water.</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<h2 class="heading__subtitle">5 Tips for a Good Night’s Rest</h2>
<p>The bedroom can serve as a multi-functional room--such as an office, library, or laundry room--but in the end, it is a sanctuary for sleep. This room should be the most luxurious and personal space in any home - a soothing oasis that is conducive to relaxation and comfort. Here are some tips on how you can design your bedroom for better sleep, which should be considered along with color options, styles, and furniture.</p>
<p><strong>1. A good mattress is the key to a good night’s rest.</strong></p>
<p>A good night's rest may be as simple as getting a new mattress. If your mattress is too lumpy, hard, or soft, it will keep you up all night trying to get comfortable. There are many different types of mattresses, such as pillow, foam, innerspring, adjustable, waterbeds, and airbeds; each type has manufacturers who guarantee comfort and better sleep.</p>
<p>When you shop for a mattress, follow these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research extensively, because this is a very important and expensive purchase.</li>
<li>Once you have a mattress in mind, test out your mattress. If your mattress has a 30 or 60 day guarantee or your money back, take advantage of it. Also, don't be afraid to try out a mattress in the store by lying down on it like you would at home.</li>
<li>Figure out what size you need (King, Queen, or Full), because this may be the reason you cannot sleep; a small mattress may be your issue, especially if you share a bed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To determine if you need a new a mattress, these simple <a href="http://www.bettersleep.org/pdfs/BetterSleepGuide_English.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5">guidelines</a> from <a href="http://www.bettersleep.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="6">The Better Sleep Council</a> can help you make that determination.</p>
<p><strong>2. One of the most important conditions needed for sound sleep is darkness.</strong></p>
<p>According to Brandon Peters, M.D., who is trained in clinical sleep medicine and neurology at the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis, explains how our mind and body's natural circadian rhythm lean towards following dark-light cycle.</p>
<div id="billboard2-sticky_1-0" class="comp billboard2-sticky billboard-sticky" data-breakpoint="medium2" data-height="600" data-parent=""> </div>
<p class="html-slice">Therefore, the amount of light in your bedroom will affect your sleep.</p>
<p>Our modern lifestyles can disrupt us from dark, calm environments that our bodies need for sleep. These modern devices are digital clocks, televisions, phones, and computers, which can light up your bedroom and interrupt your REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. Some solutions you can use in your bedroom are armoires to hide televisions or computers, and vintage open-faced alarm clocks versus bright digital alarm clocks. Remove phones from your bedroom; if it's important to have a phone in your bedroom, hide it away in a side table drawer.</p>
<p><strong>3. Air temperature can affect your sleep.</strong></p>
<p>If the room is too cold or warm, it too can affect how you sleep at night, according to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/cant-sleep-adjust-the-temperature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="10">Ralph Downey III</a>, PhD, Chief of Sleep Medicine at Loma Linda University. A simple solution, which can be tested if you believe this is your issue, is altering your thermostat. Other options you can incorporate in your bedroom to help with room temperature is a ceiling fan, portable heater, or heavy blinds and window treatments, which will help keep the room dark and prevent outside weather conditions from entering your bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>4. Soothing colors and soothing sounds make for a good night's sleep.</strong></p>
<p>Bright, vibrant colors can be fun, but sometimes it's best not to use them within a bedroom, especially if you have trouble sleeping. Instead, use calm, soothing colors like muted blues, greens, and pastels, which are more peaceful and calm. If you still would like to incorporate bright colors in your bedroom, use them as accents on your pillows or within artwork.</p>
<p>Besides color, soothing sounds can promote sleep too, such as a babbling brook, soft wind chimes, or crickets’ chirping. You can incorporate these sounds in your room with a CD player or any other electronic device hidden away; if you prefer the real thing, then place a small fountain in your bedroom or hang some wind chimes outside your window.</p>
<p><strong>5. Too much clutter can cause anxiety and lack of sleep.</strong></p>
<p>Too much clutter in your bedroom may cause your sleep deprivation.</p>
<p class="html-slice">This is a feng shui no-no and good advice to bear, since too much clutter can cause anxiety and uneasiness in any room. Try to keep your bedroom in order so you're not worried about tripping over stuff when you get up in the middle of the night or toss-and-turn about cleaning up before you go to sleep. There are several storage options you can use in your bedroom or closet that will tackle the clutter, which are appealing and affordable, too.</p>
<p>One or more of these design tips will help you maintain a sanctuary of sleep and rest in your bedroom. Next step to designing you bedroom is to determine your style, color scheme, and furniture.</p>

      <![CDATA[<div class="x-text">
<p>Ahhh, 2018 will soon be upon us. This is when you’ll sit down and draw up a list of everything you are definitely-for-sure-100-percent going to accomplish in order to become a more accomplished person, like finally becoming a dedicated yogi or growing award-winning parsley in the backyard. That’s great, we applaud you for committing to your hobbies or health! But what about your home?</p>
<p>If you are an apartment dweller, renter or homeowner, there are probably some projects you can pick up that will make your home cleaner, updated or just plain safer. We’ve put together some common New Year’s home resolutions with suggestions on achieving and then maintaining these changes through the next year. Bonus: these resolutions also make good inside DIY projects until it warms up enough to work outdoors.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h-custom-headline h3">Resolution #1: De-clutter and keep the house organized</h2>
<div class="x-text">
<p>This is probably the most common home resolution and for good reason. We’re on the tail end of the season of gift-giving and major shopping sales, so you’ve probably doubled the amount of “stuff” taking up space in the house. Time to use the three ‘E’s’: enlist, evaluate, edit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Enlist</strong> everyone in the de-cluttering; reserve a Saturday for the whole family to divide up the house and clean out every room.</li>
<li>
<strong>Evaluate</strong> toys, books, tools, appliances, clothes and various knick-knacks taking up space. What are you still using daily or weekly? What can be donated and what can be tossed?</li>
<li>
<strong>Edit</strong> these items and get them out of the house!</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is probably more difficult: keeping the house clutter-free and organized after your deep clean. We’ve written before about <a href="http://blog.homemakers.com/2016/01/home-storage-solutions-new-years-resolutions/">storage solutions</a> for New Year’s resolutions so we’ll try not to repeat ourselves too much here. Needless to say, chests, cabinets, ottomans and other pieces of furniture that can store belongings while adding style to your home are a great way to keep the house clean. Stick to a <a href="http://blog.homemakers.com/2016/01/hm-how-to-a-cleaning-schedule-youll-actually-follow/">cleaning schedule</a> in order to make picking up after yourself a habit. You can also resolve to do a deep clean and de-clutter three or four times a year, that way you won’t have to put it off until the end of the year.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h-custom-headline h3">Resolution #2: Replace old furniture</h2>
<div class="x-text">
<p>Is your couch starting to sag and fade? Have you been putting off replacing your uncomfortable mattress? Is your bookcase one knick-knack away from collapsing?</p>
<p><strong>The first step is to draw up a budget.</strong> Hopefully this was part of your resolutions anyway! If you are only replacing one piece then decide how much you can afford to spend for it. If there are several items you plan to replace, consider spreading it out so that you can work the purchases into a monthly or even quarterly budget.</p>
<p><strong>Next, decide what piece is the most important to you.</strong> If the quality of your beauty rest is dropping, it’s time to start researching <a href="http://www.homemakers.com/mattresses/?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Resolutions-_-Mattresses-_-20161227">new mattresses</a>. Determine what size you’re looking for and what style of mattress would best suit your sleep needs. We have an entire section of Hm, etc. called <a href="http://blog.homemakers.com/home-2/sleep-better/">Sleep Better! </a>which is dedicated to helping you research new mattresses.</p>
<p>The beginning of a new year is also a great time to start transitioning your style if you want to switch up the interior design of your home. You don’t have to toss out an entire room of furniture to start fresh, instead work piece by piece. If you plan to transition your living room, you can start small by changing out wall décor, ottomans and other accent furniture and even change the paint color. Depending on your budget, you can then move on to replacing the <a href="http://www.homemakers.com/sofas-and-sectionals/?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Resolutions-_-SofasandSectionals-_-20161227">sofas and sectionals</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h-custom-headline h3">Resolution #3: Indoor home maintenance projects</h2>
<div class="x-text">
<p>‘Tis the season for inside DIY projects! Now is a good time of year to get a jump start on the home maintenance projects that get pushed aside during the year such as repairs and energy-saving adjustments.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Energy, an energy-efficient heating system alone is not enough to have a significant impact on utility bills and reduce your carbon footprint. <strong>They recommend using the “whole-house approach” and offer excellent advice for making small changes in almost every room.</strong> These include insulating your water heater and pipes and using a power strip for electric devices and turning it off when not in use. During this season of cold weather and furnace use, these are some easy adjustments to make that may help you save money while still keeping you warm.</p>
<p>Another good indoor project is to freshen up a room by re-painting it. This is a fairly easy way to change the style and feel of a room without changing out every piece of furniture. Choose a new color from Pantone’s list of the colors for 2017 or do some online research into what you want. Do you want the room to feel bigger or brighter? Are you trying to make it warm and cozy?</p>
<p>Now can also be a good time to clean patio furniture. You can clean, repaint or put a new coating on your furniture to make sure it’s in top condition when spring rolls back around. This will also allow you to evaluate your outdoor furniture to see what may need to be replaced in a few months.</p>
<p>Pick a weekend or two and get to work!</p>
</div>
<h2 class="h-custom-headline h3">Resolution #4: Build a new room</h2>
<div class="x-text">
<p>So you have an extra room or space that has just been languishing as a storage room. Maybe you had high hopes when you first moved into your home to turn that extra bedroom into a home theater or perhaps you need a home office and the only space is in the basement. Whatever your situation, use your space wisely to create a brand new addition to your home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.homemakers.com/home-entertainment/?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Resolutions-_-HomeEntertainment-_-20161227">Home theaters</a> are becoming easier to integrate into your house now that Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO GO and other subscription services give you access to unlimited television and movies. This can also be a good way to spend time with family and friends indoors. Again, <strong>start by creating a budget then evaluate your space.</strong></p>
<p>If you have a large room going unused you can bring in the ultimate component of a home theater space: <a href="http://www.homemakers.com/theater-seating1/?cm_cr=No+Campaign-_-Web+Activity-_-DepartmentFeatured_Categories-_-Hot_Categories-_-Home+Theater+Seating&amp;cm_mmc=Blog-_-Resolutions-_-HomeTheaterSeating-_-20161227">home theater seating</a>. Nothing says a cozy night in watching movies better than a big leather recliner with cup holders or a sectional that fits the entire family (and the dog!). Store the TV, gaming console, games and movies in a new <a href="http://www.homemakers.com/entertainment-centers/?cm_cr=No+Campaign-_-Web+Activity-_-DepartmentFeatured_Categories-_-Hot_Categories-_-Entertainment+Centers&amp;cm_mmc=Blog-_-Resolutions-_-EntertainmentCenter-_-20161227">entertainment center</a> that will also add fresh style to the room.</p>
<p>Carving out a dedicated home office may work wonders for your productivity- much better than camping out at the dining room table every day! If you have an unused space in the basement or spare room where you can fit a <a href="http://www.homemakers.com/desks/?cm_cr=No+Campaign-_-Web+Activity-_-DepartmentFeatured_Categories-_-Hot_Categories-_-Desks&amp;cm_mmc=Blog-_-Resolutions-_-Desk-_-20161227">desk</a> and <a href="http://www.homemakers.com/office-chairs/?cm_cr=No+Campaign-_-Web+Activity-_-DepartmentFeatured_Categories-_-Hot_Categories-_-Office+Chairs&amp;cm_mmc=Blog-_-Resolutions-_-OfficeChair-_-20161227">office chair</a>, you’re already halfway there! If there is not enough space for a filing cabinet or bookcase, choose a desk with plenty of storage options for filing papers.</p>

<h2>#1 Clean and Stow Your Mower</h2>
<p>If you’re not familiar with fuel stabilizer, get to know it. If your mower sits for months with gas in its tank, the gas will slowly deteriorate, which can damage internal engine parts. Fuel stabilizer ($10 for a 10-ounce bottle) prevents gas from degrading.Add stabilizer to your gasoline can to keep spare gas in good condition over the winter, and top off your mower tank with stabilized gas before you put it away for the winter. Run the mower for five minutes to make sure the stabilizer reaches the carburetor.</p>
<p>Another <a class="internal" href="https://www.houselogic.com/news/lawns/lawn-mower-care-sharpen-blade-clean-cut/">lawn mower care</a> method is to run your mower dry before stowing it.</p>
<p>1. When the mower is cool, remove the spark plug and pour a capful of engine oil into the spark plug hole.</p>
<p>2. Pull the starter cord a couple of times to distribute the oil, which keeps pistons lubricated and ensures an easy start come spring.</p>
<p>3. Turn the mower on its side and clean out accumulated grass and gunk from the mower deck.</p>
<h2>#2 Remove Garden Hoses From Faucets</h2>
<p>Remove garden hoses from outdoor faucets. Leaving hoses attached can cause water to back up in the faucets and in the plumbing pipes just inside your exterior walls. If freezing temps hit, that water could freeze, expand, and crack the faucet or pipes. Make this an early fall priority so a sudden cold snap doesn’t sneak up and cause damage.</p>
<p>Turn off any shutoff valves on water supply lines that lead to exterior faucets. That way, you’ll guard against minor leaks that may let water enter the faucet.</p>
<p>While you’re at it, drain garden hoses and store them in a shed or <a class="internal" href="https://www.houselogic.com/home-improvement/rooms/garages/">garage</a>.</p>
<h2>#3 Drain Your Sprinkler System</h2>
<p>Time to drain your irrigation system. Even buried irrigation lines can freeze, leading to busted pipes and broken sprinkler heads.</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the water to the system at the main valve.</li>
<li>Shut off the automatic controller.</li>
<li>Open drain valves to remove water from the system.</li>
<li>Remove any above-ground sprinkler heads and shake the water out of them, then replace.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t have drain valves, then hire an irrigation pro to blow out the systems pipes with compressed air. A pro is worth the $75 to $150 charge to make sure the job is done right, and to ensure you don’t have busted pipes and sprinkler head repairs to make in the spring.</p>
<h2>#4 Seal Air Leaks</h2>
<p>Grab a couple of tubes of color-matched exterior caulk ($5 for a 12-ounce tube) and make a journey around  your home’s exterior, sealing up cracks between trim and siding, around window and door frames, and where pipes and wires enter your house. Preventing moisture from getting inside your walls is one of the least expensive — and most important — of your fall maintenance jobs. You’ll also seal air leaks that waste energy.</p>
<p>Pick a nice day when temps are above 50 degrees so caulk flows easily.</p>
<h2>#5 De-Gunk Your Gutters</h2>
<p>Clogged rain gutters can cause ice dams, which can lead to expensive repairs. After the leaves have fallen, <a class="internal" href="https://www.houselogic.com/home-advice/roofing-gutters-siding/how-to-clean-rain-gutters/">clean your gutters</a> to remove leaves, twigs, and gunk. Make sure gutters aren’t sagging and trapping water; tighten gutter hangers and downspout brackets. Replace any worn or damaged gutters and downspouts.</p>
<p>If you find colored grit from asphalt roof shingles in your gutters, beware. That sand-like grit helps protect shingles from the damaging ultraviolet rays of the sun. Look closely for other signs of roof damage (#5, below); it may be time for a roofing replacement.</p>
<p>Your downspouts should extend at least 5 feet away from your house to prevent foundation problems. If they don’t, add downspout extensions; $10 to $20 each.</p>
<h2>#6 Eyeball Your Roof</h2>
<p>If you have a steep roof or a multistory house, stay safe and use binoculars to <a class="internal" href="https://www.houselogic.com/home-advice/roofing-gutters-siding/inspecting-and-maintaining-your-roof/">inspect your roof</a> from the ground.</p>
<p>Look for warning signs: Shingles that are buckled, cracked, or missing; rust spots on flashing. Any loose, damaged, or missing shingles should be replaced immediately.</p>
<p>Black algae stains are just cosmetic, but masses of moss and lichen could signal roofing that’s decayed underneath. Call in a pro roofer for a $50 to $100 eval.</p>
<p>A plumbing vent stack usually is flashed with a rubber collar — called a boot — that may crack or loosen over time. They’ll wear out before your roof does, so make sure they’re in good shape. A pro roofer will charge $75 to $150 to replace a boot, depending on how steep your roof is.</p>
<h2>#7 Direct Your Drainage</h2>
<p>Take a close look at the soil around your <a class="internal" href="https://www.houselogic.com/maintenance-repair/preventative-home-maintenance/foundations/">foundation</a> and make sure it slopes away from your house at least 6 vertical inches over 10 feet. That way, you’ll keep water from soaking the soils around your foundation, which could lead to cracks and leaks.</p>
<p>Be sure soil doesn’t touch your siding.</p>
<h2>#8 Check Your Furnace</h2>
<p>Schedule an appointment with a heating and cooling pro to get your heating system checked and tuned up for the coming heating season. You’ll pay $50 to $100 for a checkup.</p>
<p>An annual maintenance contract ensures you’re at the top of the list for checks and shaves 20% off the cost of a single visit.</p>
<p>Change your furnace filters, too. This is a job you should do every two months anyway, but if you haven’t, now’s the time. If your HVAC includes a built-in humidifier, make sure the contractor replaces that filter.</p>
<h2>#9 Prune Plants</h2>
<p>Late fall is the best time to prune plants and trees — when the summer growth cycle is over. Your goal is to keep limbs and branches at least 3 feet from your house so moisture won’t drip onto roofing and siding, and to prevent damage to your house exterior during high winds.</p>
<p>For advice on pruning specific plants in your region, check with your <a class="external" href="http://www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">state extension service</a>.</p>
<h2>#10 Give Your Fireplace a Once-Over</h2>
<p>To <a class="internal" href="https://www.houselogic.com/home-advice/fireplaces-chimneys/how-make-sure-your-fireplace-safe/">make sure your fireplace is safe</a>, grab a flashlight and look up inside your fireplace flue to make sure the damper opens and closes properly. Open the damper and look up into the flue to make sure it’s free of birds’ nests, branches and leaves, or other obstructions. You should see daylight at the top of the chimney.</p>
<p>Check the firebox for cracked or missing bricks and mortar. If you spot any damage, order a professional <a class="internal" href="https://www.houselogic.com/home-advice/fireplaces-chimneys/chimney-inspection-facts/">f</a>ireplace and chimney inspection. An inspection costs $79 to $500.</p>
<p>You fireplace flue should be cleaned of creosote buildup every other year. A professional chimney sweep will charge $150 to $250 for the service.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>We've all browsed through blogs and flipped through magazines and seen beautifully decorated bedrooms, wondering how we could get the same look. And then we think, <em>my life would be so much better if I had a bedroom like that!</em></p>
<p>Well it's totally possible.</p>
<p>What many people don't know is that you don't need a huge budget to achieve the same look and feel in your own bedroom. It's the little things that make your bedroom comfortable.  Just follow a few of these bedroom ideas and you'll have a supremely comfortable bedroom. Just don't blame us when if you never want to leave your bed.</p>
<h2>Back To Basics</h2>
<p>Above all else, your bedroom needs to be a relaxing place that helps you achieve a restful sleep. Think about the comfort of your mattress and bed sheets. <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blog/best-mattress-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Choosing the right mattress</a> for your needs, along with a beautiful <a href="https://www.corliving.com/products/bedroom/beds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bed frame</a> and some ultra comfortable sheets will make the biggest impact when upgrading your bedroom.</p>
<h2>Unclutter</h2>
<p>If you have to maneuver around furniture and clothes lying on the ground in order to get to your bed, you've got a problem. Uncluttering your bedroom will immediately make it feel calmer and more organized, which is the goal if you want to upgrade your bedroom.</p>
<h2>Step On Something Soft</h2>
<p>An inexpensive faux sheepskin rug next to your bed is the ultimate way to get yourself ready for the day. Nothing feels better than stepping on a plush rug when you get out of bed. Actually getting out of your bed though, that's a different story...</p>
<h2>Up The Ante - Use Wallpaper</h2>
<p>Looking to spice up your bedroom? Try using wallpaper behind your headboard. Go with an interesting print that's not too bright so that your bedroom still feels calm.</p>
<h2>Clear Out Stuff Under Your Bed</h2>
<p>Did you know the mess under your bed is a breeding ground for dust bunnies? That's a scientific fact. We think.</p>
<p>The point is that upgrading your bedroom also means organizing and cleaning it too. By clearing the stuff under your bed, it'll remove the visual mess, not to mention making it significantly easier to vacuum too. By having an empty, clear space under your bed, it will shift focus back to your bed, and not the mess,</p>
<h2>Remove The TV</h2>
<p>Many people like watching TV in bed before sleeping. However, <a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/lights-out-good-nights-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a> have shown that it can lead to worse sleep quality. Avoid looking at an electronic screen 15-30 mins before bed, which will help you fall asleep faster and sleep better. That's why removing the TV in your bedroom can actually be one of the best decisions you make when upgrading your bedroom.</p>
<h2>Get Proper Curtains</h2>
<p>This means having curtains that will block the light flooding your bedroom. Good curtains will also help insulate your room in the colder months and act as a barrier to help block out some outside noise. Not to mention floor-length curtains will give your bedroom the illusion of higher ceilings.</p>
<h2>Bring In Some Plants</h2>
<p>Adding some plants in your bedroom is a great way of incorporating some nature into your home, Besides the benefit of filtering out the air, it also gives any bedroom an upgrade to make it feel like one of those bedrooms you see in magazines and blogs. For some of these easy to grow houseplants, check out <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blog/best-houseplants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Get Rid Of Unwanted Noise - Use A White Noise Machine</h2>
<p>Have you ever laid in bed and struggled to fall sleep because the hum of your refrigerator or the noise from the traffic outside is keeping you up? That's where a white noise machine comes in. It essentially drowns out all these unwanted noises to help you fall asleep faster.</p>
<h2>Wash Your Pillow Case Once A Week</h2>
<p>And wash your bed sheets once every two weeks. Everyone loves fresh, clean sheets. This also helps those who are allergic to dust mites as washing and drying your sheets will kill most dust mites.</p>
<h2>"Make Your Bed" - Your Mother</h2>
<p>No seriously, take the 15 seconds to make your bed in the morning. This will give your entire bedroom a tidy, well-kept feel and when your bedroom feels organized and in control, your life will follow suit.</p>
<h2>Dust High and Low</h2>
<p>To prevent sneezing and stuffy noses, make sure you dust every surface in your bedroom. Don't forget the top of your lamps, shelves, nightstand, and windowsill. This is especially important for those who suffer from allergies.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Imagine coming home after a long night. You stumble into your kitchen, flick the lights on and BAM - dirty dishes are piling up in the sink, the counters are full of stuff, and what is that weird smell?</p>
<p>Look, we've all been there. A messy kitchen isn't your fault. Besides, there are many enjoyable activities to do than cleaning your kitchen.</p>
<p>But what if you could just follow a simple checklist that guarantees a spotless, fresh smelling kitchen that you, and your guests, will love? Luckily for you, we compiled everything in an easy to follow checklist.</p>
<p><b>Here's How:</b></p>
<h2>Every Day</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wipe down the sink after doing the dishes or loading the dishwasher (30 seconds).</li>
<li>Wipe down the stove top (1 minute).</li>
<li>Wipe down the counters (1 minute).</li>
<li>Sweep or vacuum the floor (2 minutes).</li>
<li>Run dishwasher as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Every Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mop the floor (5 minutes).</li>
<li>Wipe the cabinets, backsplashes, and appliances (10 minutes).</li>
<li>Wash the dish rack (4 minutes).</li>
<li>Wipe the inside of the garbage can (1 minute).</li>
<li>Clean inside microwave with a sponge and mild dish detergent (3 minutes).</li>
<li>Sanitize sponges by soaking it overnight in a mixture of 1 cup hot water, 1/2 cup white vinegar, and 3 tablespoons salt (2 minutes).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Every Season</h2>
<ul>
<li>Empty and scrub down the inside of the refrigerator (30 minutes).</li>
<li>Empty and clean the insides of the utensil drawers (15 minutes).</li>
<li>Scrub down the cupboard exteriors (30 minutes).</li>
<li>Clean the stove-hood filter (10 minutes).</li>
</ul>
<h2>More Kitchen Cleaning Tips</h2>
<p><strong>Start with grouping your supplies together.</strong></p>
<p>Creating a cleaning kit by storing all your cleaning supplies in a box will make your life significantly easier. No more running around the house to find cleaning supplies, or realize you forgot something. Use a large clear Tupperware container so you can see what you have inside. A basket works too but make sure it doesn't have any holes in case any cleaning supplies leak.</p>
<p><strong>Shine floors with vinegar</strong></p>
<p>To get an unbeatable shine without harsh chemicals, mix 9 parts water with 1 part white vinegar. Use this natural solution to wash your wooden floors and you'll be surprised at how well it cleans.</p>
<p><strong>Wipe splatter on your walls</strong></p>
<p>You may not notice it, but your kitchen walls have a build up of food, oil, and water splatter and over time it can contribute to a dirty looking kitchen. You can easily get rid of this splatter with a wet cloth or paper towel dipped in a mild dish soap mix. Use a damp towel or paper towel after to get rid of any lingering soap.</p>
<p><strong>Get rid of a smelly fridge with soda, charcoal, or coffee</strong></p>
<p>A smelly fridge probably means your should take some time to throw out old food and do a quick wipedown. Once you finish, get rid of the lingering smell by pouring out a plate of unused coffee grinds to absorb strong odors. Charcoal helps absorb and get rid of sour odors really well while soda on a dish is another alternative to freshen the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>Smelly sink drain?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Pour one cup baking soda and one cup white vinegar down the drain and let the mixture sit for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Pour boiling water down the drain to flush out the mixture</li>
<li>If you have a garbage disposal, fill the drain with ice and one cup of salt. Turn on the cold water and run the disposal until all the ice is gone. This helps clean the blades and get rid of any stuck food.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Get rid of the haze in your coffee pot</strong></p>
<p>Coffee haze builds up over time, especially when you leave a pot of coffee on for a long time. Get rid of the brown haze by filling your coffee pot with ice. then squeeze a lemon into the ice and add 2 tablespoons of salt. Swirl the mixture for 2 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Put away all of the items that belong in the kitchen but are not in their proper places.</b></p>
<p>Don't allow yourself to get distracted by rearranging cabinets, drawers, etc. Simply place the items that are out back where they belong.</p>
<p><strong>You've been cleaning your oven wrong this entire time</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Start by mixing two spoonfuls of baking soda with a bit of warm water in a bowl, creating a paste.</li>
<li>Spread this paste inside your oven and let it sit for at least 12 hours.</li>
<li>Use a wet rag and wipe out the paste, then use another wet rag to clean up any leftover residue.</li>
<li>Spritz some vinegar on any leftover baking soda residue.</li>
<li>Turn on the oven at a low temperature for 15 minutes to let dry</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cleaning marble surfaces</strong></p>
<p>Always avoid abrasive cleaners like the rough part of your dish sponge. Instead, opt for microfiber clothes.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Is there a room more important than your bedroom? A serene place to rest your head after a long day. A place to lie down, collect your thoughts, and browse through your Facebook feed (come on, we all do it). As you look around, you begin to notice that everything is starting to look a little stale, the walls are getting boring and your bed is starting to creak.</p>
<p>A thoughtfully decorated bedroom delights and also offers a type of satisfaction that can only be achieved through a well-designed bedroom. Below are some useful and fresh ideas you can use to decorate your bedroom.</p>
<h2>Add Throw Pillows</h2>
<p>Throw pillows are an easy way to add color and patterns in your bedroom. They come in different sizes, ranging from standard square ones to oversized ones. We suggest going with both sizes to add visual depth to create an interesting look. When choosing colors and patterns, go for complimentary colors (they are opposite of each other on the color wheel) and go wild and mix up patterns: stripes, solids, florals, and geometrics. Don't forget about mixing up texture too.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Always use an odd number of pillows as our eyes tend to favor odd numbered groupings. This is a trick designers use.</p>
<h2>An Interesting Blanket</h2>
<p>You can drape this blanket over the end of your bed or you can use a smaller blanket to drape over a chair. Adding a blanket helps add visual variety to your bedroom by incorporating different types of fabrics and textures. That's why in the winter time, using a wool blanket not only refreshes the decor of your bedroom, it also proves valuable during those cold winter nights.</p>
<h2>Personal Artwork</h2>
<p>Hang artwork that you really enjoy. The important part is to find something that you love and that intrigues you rather than focusing on how it matches your decor. Art is meant to stand out and showcase your personality!</p>
<h2>Varied Lighting</h2>
<p>Hopefully, you have at least one table lamp in your bedroom. You can also install a simple LED light in your closet which makes rummaging through your clothes much easier. It's important to have varied lighting in your bedroom as you don't want to use harsh overhead lighting all the time.</p>
<h2>Add a Rug</h2>
<p>Imagine waking up, getting out of your bed and being greeted by a lusciously soft rug. It's the small things that can make those mornings slightly better. When choosing a rug for your bedroom, make sure your entire bed sits within the rug, with about two feet of overhang on each side. Rugs come in a variety of materials but opt for something that is an ultra soft and fluffy material. Choosing a rug with a subtle pattern can also spice up your bedroom decor.</p>
<h2>Install Floor Length Curtains</h2>
<p>Good curtains help block light, sound, heat, and cold. They also look damn good when done right. Installing floor length curtains that extend four to eight inches on both sides of your window make them look much bigger. You should also hang curtains six inches above your window to elongate your ceiling.</p>
<h2>Get a Good Mattress</h2>
<p>Buying a mattress will be one of the most important purchases of your life. That's why we recommend you purchase the best mattress you can afford. A good night's rest is incredibly important to your overall health but with so many options, how do you know what to look for? Funny you should ask because we wrote a <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blog/best-mattress-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">definitive guide to buying a mattress</a> just for you.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.corliving.ca/products/bedroom/mattresses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shop Memory Foam Mattress &gt;</a></h3>
<h2>Create a Faux Window With a Mirror</h2>
<p>By placing a mirror opposite a window, you get two benefits: it reflects natural light back into your bedroom and also creates the illusion of a second window, giving you two nice views in your bedroom. A mirror doesn't always need to be hung though, as floor length mirrors are another great alternative. <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blog/mirror-decorating-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decorating with mirrors</a> is easy and can make a great impact in your bedroom decor.</p>
<h2>Add a Headboard</h2>
<p>Adding a headboard helps turn your bed into the focal point of your room while giving you space to display photos or store your phone and alarm clock.</p>
<h2>Gallery Wall</h2>
<p>Installing a gallery wall is easy and is a great way to display photos of your family, vacations, and anything that is meaningful to you. It's a great way to create a more interesting wall, which can sometimes be hard to do.</p>
<h2>Get a Nice Bed Frame</h2>
<p>A nice bed frame is sturdy, properly holds your mattress to avoid sagging (which can shorten the mattress's life span), and ultimately looks good. Your bed should always be the focal point in your bedroom and everything else should support it. There are many things you should consider when purchasing a bed frame such as the size of your mattress and room, and what style of bed frame suits your decor.</p>

<h2>Try Dark Hues</h2>
<p>While lighter tones help make a room feel airier, darker hues help create a sense of warmth, which actually helps produce a calm and relaxing atmosphere. Paint your walls a darker color and opt for bedroom furniture that is featured in a darker toned wood such as this <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blh-370-k-ca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bed</a> and <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/baf-690-w-ca.html">dresser</a>.</p>
<h2>Add a Small Plant</h2>
<p>Add some green to your bedroom. Anything that can help bring aspects of nature indoors is always a plus since it helps create a serene environment, vital to any good bedroom. Terrariums are always a popular choice as they really up the decor in any room.

<h2>Declutter</h2>
<p>This might not be a decorating tip, but your bedroom will only feel great if it's clean and organized. Organizing your bedroom <a href="https://www.corliving.com/blog/how-to-organize-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can be very easy</a> too if you follow the right steps.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Do you want a simple way to add some visual flair to your home without having to spend a lot of cash? The answer may be using mirrors.<br>Mirrors add a very interesting and purposeful design element to your home. When done right, they can make your home feel bigger, provide more light, or just look damn good. Here are a few mirror decorating ideas you can use right now.</p>
<h2>Floor Length Mirrors</h2>
<p>A large, floor length mirror can make small entry ways feel big. When the mirrors are the same width the furniture piece in front, it looks purposeful rather than forced.</p>
<h2>Place a Mirror Behind a Light Source</h2>
<p>Whether it’s a floor lamp or a candle on a dresser, this will give your room a very magical and comfortable look while maximizing the light’s reach.</p>
<h2>The Faux Window</h2>
<p>By hanging a mirror where it will reflect natural light, it gives the illusion of another window while helping illuminate your home.</p>
<h2>Avoid Mirrors in the Kitchen</h2>
<p>Because you’re always cooking, steam and the oils will constantly get on your mirror. And do you really need another thing to clean?</p>
<h2>Avoid Mirrors In Front Of Your Bed</h2>
<p>I don’t need to be reminded of what my morning face looks like when I wake up. That’s why mirrors should be placed behind your nightstand or on a wall that doesn’t directly reflect your bed.</p>
<h2>Group of Mirrors</h2>
<p>This can be tricky, but when done correctly it can look really good.  Just remember to always use an odd number of mirrors as an odd grouping of objects are more appealing to the eye. (Drop that nugget of knowledge during your next cocktail party, people will be <em>impressed</em>).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mirrors can be a great way to add a bit of elegance to your room and can create an expansive feeling when strategically placed. Just one final piece of advice: No mirrors on the ceiling. Seriously, there will be one person reading who was thinking that was a good idea.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Buying a high-quality mattress is one of the best investments you can make. And like all investments, you want to make sure that you're taking proper care of it. By keeping your mattress properly maintained, you'll be protecting your investment as well as promoting better sleep.</p>
<h2>Read Your Warranty</h2>
<p>Carefully read your mattress's warranty so you have an understanding of what is covered and what the limits are. They'll usually include specific cleaning instructions which you'll have to follow for your warranty to be honored.</p>
<h2>Cover It Up</h2>
<p>Mattress covers act as a barrier against moisture, dust, and dirt. There are also specific covers that help those who have allergies to dust or dust mites. There is a variety of different mattress covers, some which go on top of the mattress and others that fully encase it. Whichever ones you choose, it is always a good idea to have some sort of cover as normal use can introduce oils and perspiration, which can break down the foams of your mattress, leading to premature sagging.</p>
<h2>Clean Up Spills</h2>
<p>The easiest way to clean up minor spills and stains is to use damp cloth and warm water. Try mixing a few drops of mild dish soap and then rubbing with the damp cloth (or a brush if you have one).</p>
<p>For tougher stains like blood and urine, mix a cloth dampened with a mixture of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide to scrub the stain. However, note that the hydrogen peroxide may change the color of your mattress so test a small area first.</p>
<h2>Flip and Spin</h2>
<p>Flipping or rotating your mattress once every six months help offset the normal settling that happens when you sleep. This ensures you can have an even sleeping surface through the lifetime of your mattress.</p>
<p>(Note that newer mattresses are designed "bottom-up" so they cannot be flipped).</p>
<p>However, when your mattress starts getting really old, no amount of flipping or rotating is going to help.</p>
<h2>Buy A Mattress Protector</h2>
<p>A mattress protector is a thin, waterproof cover that goes on top of your mattress. These usually don't add any padding but acts as a great barrier to protect your mattress from potentially smelly stains.</p>
<h2>Be Careful When Moving Your Mattress</h2>
<p>Some foam mattresses are designed so that some bending is totally okay. However, you should be much more cautious if you own a spring coil mattress. Use extra caution when moving your mattress around, especially if you're moving. Avoid cramming it into your car and ensure you have some sort of protection, either wrapping it up in blankets or keeping it in a mattress bag.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Do you look at the latest Pinterest boards full of beautiful and inviting homes and wonder how they create such a space? The truth is that you don’t need to hire an interior designer in order to get your home looking just as good. All you have to do is follow these simple steps in to create a warm, inviting home.</p>
<h2>Step 1 - Make A Great First Impression</h2>
<p>Never underestimate first impressions. That’s why the first thing you should focus on is your front door and entryway. An attractive welcome mat, clean porch, and even a nice rug for guests to walk on when they step into your home will go a long way in creating an inviting home. Try adding a few plants and flowers to give your entryway a natural, inviting feel.</p>
<h2>Step 2 - Help Guide Your Guests</h2>
<p>Guide your guests' eyes into your home. What will be the first things your guests notice when they step into your home? By painting a far wall a bold color, or having artwork on the far walls, this gives your guests a visual cue of where they will move, thus inviting them to further explore your home.</p>
<h2>Step 3 - Unclutter</h2>
<p>Unclutter. Create enough space for guests to walk around without having to move, squeeze, and shuffle their way around. Remember that guests often feel uncomfortable moving around your furniture to get around. In order to make your guests feel more comfortable, it’s important to ensure that your space has room to breathe and stays uncluttered (link to Home Organization Tips)</p>
<h2>Step 4 - Get A House Plant</h2>
<p>Bring some life into your home by keeping plenty of <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blog/best-houseplants/">plants and flowers</a> around your home. Even something small like a terrarium can add a great sense of warmth to any space.</p>
<h2>Step 5 - Blankets, Throws, Pillows, and More!</h2>
<p>Add soft touches. Incorporate soft textiles in every room possible. Think of blankets hung on your couch, rugs under the coffee table and dining table, or plenty of pillows for your guests to lean on. Mixing in soft textiles around your home is one of the easiest ways to add comfort and warmth to any space.</p>
<h2>Step 6 - Ambient Lighting</h2>
<p>Lighting is one of the most important factors that many people overlook. Multiple light sources give any room versatility – bright lights for large gatherings and table lamps for a more intimate feel. <strong>Tip:</strong> install a simple dimmer switch to easily control the ambiance in any given room. Learn how you can <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blog/interior-lighting-guide/">light your home the right way</a>.</p>
<h2>Step 7 - Keep It Personal</h2>
<p>Make your home personal. Display photos of your adventures, family, and cool landscapes you took yourself! Keep your books neatly displayed on your bookshelf or coffee table. Not only do they make good a conversation piece, it also personalizes your home. This adds personality to your home and makes your place feeling more like a home and less like a catalog.</p>
<p>Creating an inviting home is a lot easier than many people think. By incorporating these steps into your home, you can instantly create a warm, inviting place without the need to hire an expert to do it!</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>I want to talk to you about how your home could be harming you and your family's health - and you may not even know it.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about how the paint on your walls, your carpet, or your food can be causing you harm? This post will show you how to create a healthier home.</p>
<p>This guide will show you what to get rid of in your home and what you can do to make sure your home is a healthier place for you and your family.</p>
<h2>Improve Indoor Air Quality</h2>
<p>Let's get a scary fact out of the way first: There has been <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/inside-story-guide-indoor-air-quality">mounting evidence</a> by the EPA that the air inside homes can be more polluted than outside. What's worse is that we spend about 90% of our day indoors.</p>
<p>Scary right? But don't fret. Here's what you can do to quickly improve the air quality in your home.</p>
<p><strong>Gas stoves, wood burning fireplaces, and malfunctioning heating devices</strong> are the biggest sources of indoor pollutants. They spew out carcinogens and carbon monoxide. Here are the fixes:</p>
<p><strong>Gas Stoves -</strong> <a href="http://www.abe.iastate.edu/extension-and-outreach/carbon-monoxide-poisoning-gas-fired-kitchen-ranges-aen-205/">51%</a> of kitchens with gas stoves tested have carbon monoxide levels higher than the EPA standard. When using your gas stove, ensure your kitchen fan is on and set to high as long as your stove is in use. Also, open a few windows to allow fresh air to come in and for the carbon monoxide to leave your home. NEVER use a gas stove as a heat source.</p>
<p><strong>Wood Burning Fireplace -</strong> The flame from a fireplace has a mystical effect that we all gravitate to. But honestly, it's not worth the health risk. The smoke that comes from burning wood can cause breathing and heart problems. The best and easiest solution is to simply not use your fireplace. If the fireplace or wood stove is your only source of heat, you can do these things to avoid the health risks of using a fireplace.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fireplace damper must be open when the fireplace is in use, which allows the smoke and gasses to exit.</li>
<li>Ensure a fresh air supply into your home before lighting the fire.</li>
<li>Some fireplaces come with their own combustion air duct. If yours is not equipped with this duct, you must have a fresh air supply, such as an open window.</li>
<li>Keep the fresh air supply available, even overnight, until the fire is completely out.</li>
<li>Keep the damper closed when the fireplace is not in use.</li>
<li>Never burn wood that has been painted or chemically treated.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Heaters - </b>Ensure the vents are properly vented to the outside and there are no leaks. This can be done with periodic professional inspections.</p>
<p><strong>Open A Few Windows - </strong>Get the benefit of fresh air without having to go outside! Open a few windows when the weather permits to cycle fresh air into your home and the stale air out. But you should probably go outside for some fresh air. Netflix has a pause button you know.</p>
<h2>Get Dust Under Control</h2>
<p>Dust can trigger allergies and affect people with asthma. It even holds onto chemicals for years. The simplest way to get rid of dust is to vacuum frequently, ensuring you get under furniture and the corners along the floorboard. For those who want an excuse to install hardwood floors, now would be the best time as they are significantly easier to clean.</p>
<h2>Prevent Mold Build Up</h2>
<p>Mold releases spores that can cause respiratory problems, allergies, and rashes. Mold will grow in damp areas so one of the best ways to prevent mold build up is to ensure your home's humidity doesn't exceed 50%. This can be done by either opening windows (if it's dry outside) or by using a dehumidifier.</p>
<p>Other ways to prevent mold buildup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep areas dry - this means drying wet areas from a leaky pipe or a spill on the carpet right away. You should also keep your shower curtains closed after showering which allows it to dry more quickly.</li>
<li>Properly ventilate your home to prevent mold from growing.</li>
<li>Clean your gutters and repair your roof. Often a damaged roof and overflowing gutters allow moisture to build up and leak into your crawl spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Throw Away Air Fresheners</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scher/docs/scher_o_026.pdf">study</a> tested 72 air fresheners and found that they contained 350 different chemicals and allergens, some known to cause reduced lung function and increase asthma rates in humans. Most air fresheners work by simply masking the smell with a stronger scent. Instead, you should opt to use fragrant flowers and plants as a natural alternative.</p>
<h2>Test For Radon</h2>
<p>Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer, following smoking. It is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that results from decaying radium in soil. It's also completely colorless, odorless, and tasteless.</p>
<p>When radium decays, it releases a decay product that attaches to airborne particles which are then inhaled and end up in your lungs. You can purchase a radon detection kit online or at your local hardware store. For more information on radon, click <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/radon">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Don't Bother With Pesticides</h2>
<p>Long-term exposure to pesticides is known to cause a wide range of health issues for young children such as asthma, learning disabilities, and affect early brain development.</p>
<p>Instead, prevent insects and rodents from coming into your home by:</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning your home</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wiping up spills immediately and clean any sticky surfaces using water and soap.</li>
<li>Take out the garbage daily or ensure your garbage can has an air tight lid. Make sure there is no food residue on the outside or lid of the garbage can.</li>
<li>Keep ripe fruits in the fridge.</li>
<li>Vacuum and sweep floors regularly.</li>
<li>Keep all your food and beverages in covered containers. This also means any ingredients you use for cooking/baking such as sugar, flour, etc.</li>
<li>Check for any small pools of water in your home caused by leaky faucets or pipes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sealing Entryways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use silicon caulk to seal cracks and crevices by windows and doorways.</li>
<li>Keep tall plants and other tall objects outside, away from windows and doors of your home to prevent pests from climbing them to get into your home.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use chemical free traps like flytraps, jar traps, pheromone traps, and light boxes.</strong></p>
<p>If you're still having pest issues you should consult a professional pest management company that can offer low-toxicity products to manage your pest problem.</p>
<h2>Limit Use Of Plastic Bottles</h2>
<p>Some studies have shown that higher levels of Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical found in polycarbonate plastics, in a person's urine meant they were more likely to have a history of heart disease or diabetes. While BPA is deemed safe to hold food, it is advised that you do your best to decrease exposure to it as much as possible. This means you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use baby bottles made of tempered glass or plastic bottles with the recycling symbols 1, 2, or 5. Avoid those marked with a '7' or 'PC'.</li>
<li>Don't microwave plastic containers as the heat breaks down plastic fibers.</li>
<li>Don't microwave cling wrap. Cover your food with a paper towel or waxed paper instead.</li>
<li>Use ceramic or glass containers to store food.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ditch Bottled Water</h2>
<p>I used to be one of those chumps who would buy something that was marked up <strong>4000%</strong> even though I could get it for dirt cheap. That something was bottled water.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that all those water bottles are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/norm-schriever/post_5218_b_3613577.html">devastating</a> the environment. <strong>Here's what to do instead - </strong>Drink tap water! Tap water is rigorously tested and regulated by the EPA while bottle water has no such requirement. In fact, some bottled water <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/water/drinking/bw/chap3.asp">tested</a> had MORE chemical contaminants than allowed by health-protective limits in California (where the 4-year study was conducted).</p>
<p>Use a glass, ceramic, or aluminum water bottle to hold tap water. If you want to filter your tap water, a simple pitcher-type filter is all you need. If you're feeling fancy, you can install a filter that attaches directly to the faucet for instant filtered water.</p>
<h2>Check Your Paint For Lead</h2>
<p>If your home was built before 1978, there is a chance the paint covering your walls and exterior contain traces of lead, a toxic metal that can cause serious harm to you and your family. If you're planning to do some remodeling of your home, you might be spreading lead around the house as it mixes with the dust and soil.</p>
<p>A simple way to test if your walls is to call an inspector. It is highly recommended you hire a professional to conduct this test due to the toxicity of lead paint. Unfortunately, the only way to get rid of lead paint is to hire a certified lead abatement contractor.</p>
<h2>Know Which Food Is Worth Buying Organic</h2>
<p>Despite what health magazines and talk shows are telling us, eating completely organic is not necessarily worth the extra costs as the health benefits are minimal. Yeah, we know everyone loves Whole Foods but if you have other expenses besides food, you should know which organic produce is actually worth buying.</p>
<p><strong>Apples - </strong>Pesticides line the skin of apples, which also happen to contain the most nutrients. Organic apples are worth buying as the price difference is fairly minimal.</p>
<p><strong>Baby Food - </strong>Babies are more susceptible to the negative health impacts of pesticides, which is why buying organic baby food is recommended. To offset the cost, look to purchase it in bulk.</p>
<p><strong>Strawberries and Blueberries - </strong>Their relatively thin skin means pesticides are liberally used to protect against pests.</p>
<p><strong>Peaches and Nectarines - </strong>Same deal here - thin skin means pesticides will be used and can seep into the fruit even if you get rid of the skin.</p>
<p><strong>Celery - </strong>Due to its porous nature and that it grows mostly above ground, opt for organic celery.</p>
<p><strong>Milk - </strong>Milk cows are being treated with hormones so they produce more milk. If you drink a lot of milk, opt for organic.</p>
<p><strong>Tomatoes - </strong>Organic tomatoes actually contain more nutrients according to a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90914182">study</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cucumbers - </strong>Cucumbers are treated with a petroleum-based wax to preserve freshness, however, this wax often clings onto pesticides and is very difficult to completely wash off.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>A bed frame is usually the focal point in most bedrooms. That means you'll want a <a href="https://www.corliving.com/products/bedroom/beds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well designed and sturdy</a> one that will last for years. Depending on the design of the bed frame, you might need to purchase a box spring so it elevates your bed, however if you want to save money, choose a bed frame that is designed without the need for one.</p>
<p>There are many things you should consider before buying a bed frame such as what room the bed frame is going into, the amount of space available, the decor of the room, how easily movable the bed frame is, and your budget.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to consider when buying a bed frame:</p>
<h2>Which Room Will the Bed Frame Go Into?</h2>
<p>The bed frame you choose will depend greatly on the room that it's going into.</p>
<p><strong>Master Bedroom </strong>- This is where you'll want to buy something that's both beautifully designed and well constructed as you'll want it to last a very long time. It is recommended that you buy the biggest bed possible for your room if you sleep with a partner. The extra space allows for a more comfortable sleep for the both of you.</p>
<p><strong>Guest Bedroom</strong> - If your guest bedroom doesn't see much use, it's okay to buy something more budget friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Kid's Bedroom</strong> - A <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/departments/bedroom/bunk-beds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bunk bed</a> is always a great option if you need to maximize space, especially if it can be separated into two beds. This gives you more flexibility if your kids get their own rooms in the future.</p>
<h2>How Big Is The Room?</h2>
<p>The most difficult part in choosing the size of your bed frame is the balance between comfort and how it fits in your room. If you sleep with a partner, you'll want to have enough room on each side of your bed to easily get in and out of. But if you still want a larger bed but might be limited with space, you can push your bed against the side of a wall to maximize the space in your room.</p>

<h2>What Is the Decor of the Room?</h2>
<p>It is important to buy a bed frame that compliments the decor of your room because no matter how well designed a bed frame is, if it doesn't compliment your decor, it will look out of place.</p>
<p>The easiest style of bed frames to buy are ones that feature very clean lines and with minimal flourishes. Bed frames constructed out of wood also give a room more warmth which is important if you want to create a calming environment that promotes better sleep.</p>
<h2>How Movable Is the Bed Frame?</h2>
<p>Many bed frames do not disassemble into smaller pieces so you'll always want to measure doorways, hallways, and stairways to make sure the bed can be moved into your rooms. Make sure to mention these measurements when purchasing your bed frame so that the movers are able to make a note of it.</p>
<p>You can also purchase bed frames that are flat packed, which makes moving it into your room significantly easier.</p>
<h2>What's Your Budget?</h2>
<p>You'll always want to purchase the biggest bed frame that your space allows and because this item directly impacts your sleep, you should always buy the best you can afford. Never skimp on your mattress or bed as sleep is one of the most important factors that determine happiness and productivity.</p>
<h2>Different Frame Styles</h2>
<p><strong>Canopy </strong>- A bed with a draped fabric cover supported by a four-poster frame.</p>
<p><strong>Four Poster </strong>- A bed that features four tall posts, one in each corner. These look very lavish and can instantly create an upscale feeling in any bedroom. They offer a dramatic design statement so they might not be right for everyone's tastes.</p>
<p><strong>Sleigh </strong>- Originally called French beds, these nineteenth-century design inspired beds feature a scrolled headboard and foot board.</p>
<p><strong>Platform</strong> - Although platform beds are one of the oldest styles, they are making a modern comeback. A platform bed sits lower to the ground and features a clean, simple style. Perfect for those who want an uncluttered look in the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>Daybed</strong>: Designed to look like a sofa, daybeds generally hold a twin-sized mattress. Day beds are a very popular option in guest bedrooms, dens, or family rooms because they resemble a large sofa more than a bed.</p>
<p><strong>Trundle</strong>: A low bed on casters that’s stored by sliding under another bed. These offer extra sleeping space in a pinch, especially for sleepovers and unexpected guests.</p>

    <title>10 Ways To Organize Your Bedroom</title>
    <author>
      <name>Rheagan Thompson</name>

      <![CDATA[<p>Creating an organized bedroom is important in creating an environment that promotes calmness and tranquility - both important if you want a restful nights sleep.</p>
<p>Organizing your bedroom is easy, just follow these few tips.</p>
<h2>Don't Follow Magazines</h2>
<p>Sure, those beautifully designed bedrooms look great, but of course they do, they're styled specifically for entertainment, not practicality. It's important to go minimal in your bedroom. That way you can create an open space that allows you to keep everything organized and spacious enough to feel comfortable.</p>
<p>These are the important items every organized bedroom will need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dresser with deep shelves - deep shelves will give you plenty of room to store your clothes.</li>
<li>Small nightstand with shelves - The top of your nightstand will only need to hold a lamp and alarm clock (or you can just use your phone as one to save space). The shelves will give you a place to keep smaller items out of sight but easily within reach.</li>
<li>A headboard with storage - while not everyone will need a headboard with built-in storage, it is extremely convenient and gives you a place to display decor pieces that you love.</li>
<li>Proper closet storage - this means built in shelves and containers to help you keep everything organized.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Use The Space Under Your Bed</h2>
<p>If you've got limited closet space, purchase large plastic containers to store your large winter coats and shoes when they're not in season. Keeping them enclosed in containers under your bed will keep everything neat, tidy and out of sight. Make sure you remember to wash your coats before storing in them to prevent damage caused by moths.</p>
<h2>Make Decluttering A Priority</h2>
<p><em>This is important.</em></p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is take a hard look at all the items you have in your bedroom. Donate and toss out old clothes, pieces of furniture that you don't use, and any other items that have been collecting over the years.</p>
<p>You should always spend some time organizing your closet, clearing your nightstand, and dusting to keep your bedroom clean and organized. You don't have to spend a lot of time, in fact, 5 minutes a day will be enough to keep your bedroom consistently clean and organized.</p>
<h2>Buy A Blanket Rack</h2>
<p>If you have a variety of throws and quilts that you use regularly, consider getting a blanket rack. This will help you resist the urge to just throw everything on the floor.</p>
<h2>Keep Your Nightstand Clear</h2>
<p>It's tempting to keep a lot of stuff on your nightstand, but you should always have a clutter free and simple nightstand that helps you in the sleep process. Keep all your other stuff in the drawers so they're still within reach but don't make your bedroom look cluttered.</p>
<h2>You Need A Hamper</h2>
<p>That way you'll be able to easily throw away your dirty clothes in a hamper instead of leaving them in a pile on the floor.</p>
<h2>Move Out Your Electronics</h2>
<p>First start with your TV. We all probably spend more time watching TV than we should. But simply removing the TV out of your bedroom removes the temptation to turn it on when you get ready for bed. (That's what your cell phone is for).</p>
<p>Speaking of cell phones, did you know that looking at an electronic screen before going to bed can have a negative impact on your sleep? To resist the temptation, some people charge their phones across the room so that they won't be tempted to look at it every time they get a notification.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you use your computer to do work in your bedroom, you should probably stop now. Reserve computer usage to outside your bedroom so that you don't bring the stress of work into a place of relaxation.</p>
<h2>Maximize Your Storage Space</h2>
<p>One way to maximize storage is by purchasing pieces that have built-in hidden storage <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/lad-174-o-ca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like this ottoman</a> or this <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/ldf-121-o-ca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bedroom bench</a>.</p>
<h2>Keep a jewelry box</h2>
<p>You never want to misplace expensive jewelry or accidentally damage it. That's why a jewelry box is a necessity and also a convenient way to keep everything organized.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Everyone makes decorating mistakes once in a while, even expert designers themselves. While what looks 'good' is always subjective, our goal is to provide you with a few rules of thumb that can take your home decor to the next level. Take a look at which decorating mistakes you should avoid.</p>
<h2>Monochromatic</h2>
<p>Decorating with a single color may seem like a safe idea at first, but can result in a rather boring interior. Combing complimentary colors with different patterns and neutral tones will result in a more robust interior color palette.</p>
<h2>Too Many Big Plants</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blog/best-houseplants/">Incorporating plants into your home</a> can be a great way to add a natural and warm element into your decor. But when your home has more foliage than your backyard, you might be going a bit overboard. Instead, go for smaller plants and flowers that can be placed on counters and shelves. Terrariums are a great alternative too.</p>
<h2>Buying Cheap Furniture</h2>
<p>It's never worth skimping on important pieces of furniture that you use daily. The rule of thumb is to always buy the best you can afford and to never overspend on trendy pieces that may go out of fashion within a few years.</p>
<h2>Too Many Patterns</h2>
<p>Mixing different patterns is a great decorating trick, but always be careful you're not overdoing it. The trick to pattern mixing is only using a few at a time and using it as a highlight rather than a main focal point. Too many patterns can be distracting and look confusing to the eye.</p>
<h2>Too Many Throw Pillows</h2>
<p>Look, we get that pillows are soft, comfy, and a great decor item to add some pattern and color to your rooms. But If you find that you have to move throw pillows off the couch before sitting on it, you probably have too many pillows.</p>
<h2>Treating Every Room as a Separate Unit</h2>
<p>It might be easy to give each room in your home its own decor theme, but all your rooms should relate to each other. Try coordinating styles and colors to a certain extent to avoid making your home look disjointed and choppy.</p>
<h2>Buying Everything At Once</h2>
<p>It's important to take your time when decorating your home. You won't be able to furnish your entire room in a single day, so think carefully about which pieces you want in your room and spend time researching (we have plenty of useful guides which <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blog">you can access here</a>).</p>
<h2>Not Enough Lighting</h2>
<p>One often overlooked element in homes is lighting. It plays a crucial part in setting the ambiance in your home. That means you should always have a mixture of different lighting in each room, from overhead to task lighting. To learn how to properly light your home, <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blog/interior-lighting-guide/">read this guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Everything Matches</h2>
<p>An extremely common mistake is that by trying to create a cohesive home decor, everything ends up matching. This results in a bland home with rooms that lack a distinct focal point. Reset your mindset - try to find things that complement each other rather than match.</p>
<h2>Rugs That Are Too Small</h2>
<p>Area rugs should be big enough so that your furniture sits within it, with about 10-20" between the edge of the rug and the wall. This will help ground a room and make your rooms feel much cozier.</p>
<h2>You Have Too Much Stuff</h2>
<p>One common problem that many people face in their home is that it is too packed with stuff. Every room should have enough space that you can easily move through it. Your home should also feel uncluttered. Take a hard look at the things around your home and donate or throw out items you no longer use and need.</p>
<h2>Choosing Paint Color First</h2>
<p>It's very tempting to choose a wall color for your rooms before you have a chance to fully furnish it. It's often much easier to completely furnish your home, then choose a wall color that complements your decor. This will allow you to find pieces of furniture you love, without the constraint of needing it to match your walls.</p>
<h2>Forgetting To Test Paint Color</h2>
<p>Paint colors labeled on cans may look vastly different when it is on your walls. The lighting and decor of your home will greatly impact how the color looks. That's why it's important to test different colors so that you can pick the best one for each room.</p>
<p>You can test in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Paint a large spot on your wall with different hues and colors. That way you can determine what shade works best.</li>
<li>Paint a large piece of cardboard. This allows you to move it from room to room to determine what colors work better for each room. You never know if a color you picked for your bedroom might end up working better in a different room.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hanging Artwork Too High</h2>
<p>Did you know that there's a proper way to hang your art and photos? It's called the gallery method and is used by museums and galleries around the world. Your artwork should always be hung in a way so that the center of the painting is at eye level.</p>
<h2>Pushing Furniture Against the Wall</h2>
<p>Furniture should never be placed right against your walls. Instead, there should always be a few inches between the wall and the back of your furniture which helps create a cozier feeling home.</p>
<h2>Grouping Candles Together</h2>
<p>Take a balanced approach with your candles. Instead of grouping them together, spread them around the room. The flame is a natural light source and will look best when it is evenly dispersed in your room.</p>
<h2>Lack of a Mix of Materials</h2>
<p>It's always important to incorporate a mix of textures in your home. This means mixing up fabrics, finishes, and textures to create a layered, dimensional space. You can often add texture to your home by adding throw pillows, blankets, and decor items that use materials such as brass, wood, or even concrete. By mixing up textures, you'll be able to create visual interest in your home and keep your home from feeling boring.</p>
<h2>Hanging Cheap Curtains</h2>
<p>The proper curtains can make your room feel bigger, more comfortable, and properly block out light and some unwanted noise. Learn how to <a href="https://www.corliving.ca/blog/choosing-the-right-curtains/">choose the best curtains</a> for your needs.</p>

<p>Taking care of a houseplant is a lot easier than you might think. Of course they need a little care here and there, but the end results are worth it, not to mention the satisfaction you get from keeping something alive.</p>
<p>Here are 9 of the easiest to grow houseplants you can incorporate into your home right now. We've even included instructions for taking care of them (you're welcome).</p>
<h2>Bromeliad</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-369" src="https://www.corliving.com/wp_us/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/9726119751_384ac65d82_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="165"></p>
<p><em>Image from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/29233640@N07/9726119751/in/photolist-fPsUxR-6juvyV-nCH9z-bAEagq-bNyMYt-5f58jo-dnDdRz-86Ehjv-84m9Ge-nRjPDL-584D1k-AdVpTZ-7NzdX5-6pJ9NL-71nAQg-jG3YHX-jG3YA2-jG3YzF-jG3Yh6-jG3Yac-6juvtD-pt63V-5eZJxr-bK46Bg-76wM5Y-sUmDy-p58GbY-nNTqhi-84UVrV-f8NFyE-pMs7xz-dvKjmL-r5FVN4-9tEWYg-brTdit-s9M1yd-77iGAU-9hg7Eh-9hghfN-9hgh9C-9hghcf-D9zzR-9h6dE4-pB1DkM-dno8bg-eVM2kG-3Q7tC-brUaMa-9hghi7-dnFVUw">Flickr Creative Commons</a></em></p>
<p>Colorful and exotic, the bromeliad adds a vibrant touch to any space.</p>
<p><strong>How To Care For A Bromeliad Plant</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water</strong> - Bromeliads are more drought resistant which means you should not over water them. Ensure that the pot has drainage holes. Each time you water your bromeliad, make sure the water runs from the drainage holes, which will remove any salt build up in your pot. Water the bromeliad only when there are at least two inches of dry soil on top.</p>
<p><strong>Humidity </strong>- Because bromeliads require a humidity of 60%, it can be a bit difficult to achieve this in a home that is heated by a furnace. There are a few easy ways to increase humidity levels by your plant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a humidifier by your plant.</li>
<li>Place a shallow tray under your pot and fill it with water. This will add moisture in the air, increasing humidity.</li>
<li>Surround the bromeliad with other plants.</li>
<li>Use a spray bottle to mist your plant regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Light</strong> - Bromeliads prefer bright, sunny spaces but avoid putting them in direct sunlight.</p>
<h2>Cast Iron Plant</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-370" src="https://www.corliving.com/wp_us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/5380005620_dc100e60d7_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"></p>
<p><em>Image from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/halfrain/5380005620/in/photolist-9cpWeA-oAxwG1-dnKNjq-bFLVCk-zdV8PE-8MR1Yu-dACeDA-36BeHz-9v6mkQ-bLF3gk-8MN1cv-pE4VC8-8MN14Z-pssUY9-bY57F3-pvtxeo-36BeHn-nqxc9h-azAzWw-8MMZVK-ptrYkP-oRp1iv-9MWUxX-9MZGyf-q7u87b-8MQZ8S-eiCGXw-6QwMte-eZbDNL-eZbo6J-eZbsSj-rSvy3Z-aavSCU-eYZ86t-pnG2LM-in133-pX1Bj4-nPA2x7-nxgp3g-s6ijBh-9Q4uC7-84385o-snQgAF-9Q4uyU-a4STyn-9JZWv1-r4VEyK-pBK1s5-a9xioF-iivQR4">Flickr Creative Commons</a></em></p>
<p>An extremely hardy houseplant, this is a favorite for people who want a beautiful plant that's low maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>How To Care For A Cast Iron Plant</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water</strong> - Just make sure that the soil is always slightly damp and you're good to go!</p>
<p><strong>Humidity</strong> - I'll be honest with you, it doesn't matter. Just make sure you're not keeping it next to a heat vent and you're good to go.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong> - As long as it gets some indirect sunlight, your cast iron plant will be fine. Just remember to avoid direct sunlight.</p>
<h2>Jade Plant</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-371" src="https://www.corliving.com/wp_us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3740831412_29dd99e9ae_m.jpg" alt="3740831412_29dd99e9ae_m" width="240" height="180"></p>

<p>Easy to grow and considered symbols of good luck, jade plants are a popular houseplant.</p>
<p><strong>How To Care For A Jade Plant</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water</strong> - It is important to make sure the soil never dries out, but avoid overwatering it as it can lead to root rot. You'll know it's time to water it when the top of the soil is dry to the touch. If you notice your jade plant is losing leaves or has leaf spots, it means that it's underwatered.</p>
<p><b>Humidity</b> - The jade plant likes low humidity, ranging from 30% to 50%. You'll want to grow it in a place with plenty of air circulation and away from other plants to avoid other plants humidifying one another. If you live in a humid area, keep your jade plant near a heat source.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong> - Jade plants love light so keep them by windowsills or in a room that gets a lot of sunlight throughout the day.</p>
<h2>Prayer Plant</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-372" src="https://www.corliving.com/wp_us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3638315881_52fe096e7b_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"></p>

<p>Their large leaves fold together at night, looking like hands closed in prayer, hence its name. The prayer plant has large leaves with a beautiful light and dark green pattern.</p>
<p><strong>How To Care For A Prayer Plant</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water</strong> - Keep the soil evenly moist during spring through summer, slightly drier in winter.</p>
<p><strong>Humidity </strong>- Prayer plants prefers a humidity of 50%, which means they should be kept around other plants, placed on top of a shallow tray of water, or misted frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong> - Jade plants prefer brightly lit rooms but out of direct sunlight.</p>

<p>While these require a bit of work to ensure they bloom by the holidays, the (small) effort it takes is completely worth it.</p>
<p><strong>How To Care For A Christmas Cactus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water</strong> - Throughout the year, water the Christmas cactus enough so that the soil remains moist. Water again once the top of the soil is dry to the touch. During the fall and winter months, cut back on the watering to allow the cactus to bloom.</p>
<p><strong>Humidity</strong> - The Christmas Cactus prefers a humidity of 50% to 60%, which means they should be kept around other plants, placed on top of a shallow tray of water, or misted frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong> - In the fall months they should be kept in a room with a lot of indirect sunlight but in total darkness during the night.</p>
<h2>Parlour Palm</h2>

<p>Beautiful and delicate, the parlour palm is lauded for it's effective ability to clean the air. It even made NASA's list of 50 air cleaning indoor plants. They tend to grow at a slower pace so a little patience is required with this one.</p>
<p><strong>How To Care For A Parlour Palm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water</strong> - Parlour palms are sensitive to over watering so ensure that the pot allows some sort of drainage. You'll know to water it once the top of the soil is dry to the touch. In the winter, the parlour palm requires less watering as it prefers to be drier during this time.</p>
<p><strong>Humidity</strong> - Parlour palms prefer moderate humidity and frequent misting is advised.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong> - These plants are considered low-light plants, which means keeping them in a room with lots of light but out of direct sunlight is ideal.</p>
<h2>Philodendron</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-380" src="https://www.corliving.com/wp_us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Philodendron_insigne_-_71-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></p>
<p><em>Image from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Philodendron_insigne_-_71.jpg">Wikipedia Commons</a></em></p>
<p>This highly adaptable plant is a mainstay in many interior gardens and favoured for their ease of care and high adaptability.</p>
<p><strong>How To Care For A Philodendron</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water</strong> - When watering, allow the top inch of the soil to dry out before waterings.</p>
<p><strong>Humidity</strong> - Philodendrons prefer a moderate humidity that's found in most homes, however, they grow best in slightly high humidity, which means placing them by other plants, keeping a shallow tray of water near it, or constant misting will promote lush growth and shiny foliage.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong> - Philodendrons prefer bright, indirect sunlight. If you notice that the stems are long and leggy with several inches between leaves, it's a sign it's not getting enough sunlight.</p>
<h2>Crown Of Thorns</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-377" src="https://www.corliving.com/wp_us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/9538185935_fa9c41c31c_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="159"></p>
<p><em>Image from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jcapaldi/9538185935/in/photolist-fwRGnD-fYU89-fYUaR-5Ay6dr-btrmm7-iq9yXJ-6viJqj-6vexMX-5Ay5hB-aA7fmi-cwND6m-craZFm-cz4NAq-67eor3-2Ubf9H-cwUj33-ah5CdS-bmWLdy-5fJrvv-7pPPPt-cTWSrf-6vex9p-e8BKbb-4v3pZ8-e8BKaC-ah5DGW-6ycdGe-aZ76wB-e8w4Ee-6V3s7V-4wF9Qr-7t5ZQg-e6gseV-6AbV1u-e6gekr-6M11Nh-ehxAQ7-AXTboo-e8w4Dz-e8w4Eg-9jgw5n-4xGnQp-egtMkJ-5MWuBK-67hnmT-5dE7C4-2AYHjy-4uRQcH-9ADkt7-6qZWPK">Flickr Creative Commons</a></em></p>
<p>Highly adaptable and thrives in most home environments, this plant is easy to grow and bloom almost year round. The only downside is the thorns and sap can cause blisters and swelling.</p>
<p><strong>Water</strong> - From spring to late fall, you can water the plant by flooding the pot and waiting for the excess water to drain onto a pan under the pot. Then empty this pan to avoid soaking the roots in water. Rewater when the top inch of soil becomes dry,</p>
<p><strong>Humidity</strong> - The plant is fairly adaptable and will grow in your average indoor environment, even if it gets a little dry.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong> - Make sure the crown of thorns gets 4 hours of direct sunlight each day.</p>
<h2>Snake Plant</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-381" src="https://www.corliving.com/wp_us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Snake_plant-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></p>
<p><em>Image from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snake_plant.jpg">Wikipedia Commons</a></em></p>
<p>Also known as mother-in-law's tongue, this plant features sword-shaped leaves that are smooth and waxy. They are very visually striking and popular among interior designers. Extremely versatile and hardy, this is an easy addition to any interior garden.</p>
<p><strong>Water</strong> - Snake plants aren't finicky about water, as long as they are not overwatered. Water when the soil is dry and during the winter months, water once a month.</p>
<p><b>Humidity</b> - The average home humidity is perfect for a snake plant.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong> - Place your snake plant in a bright room with plenty of indirect sunlight.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Our interior lighting guide will show you the best way to light your home. The right interior lighting is vital for a beautiful home and to prevent it from feeling like an office.</p>
<p>The <strong>biggest mistake</strong> people make is overly bright lighting.<strong> </strong>When the overhead glare of your lights reminds your guests of their cubicle at work, you've got a problem.</p>
<p>Try to <b>localize your lighting</b>. This means having other sources of light such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Floor Lamps</li>
<li>Table Lamps</li>
<li>Task Lighting</li>
<li>Recessed Lighting</li>
<li>Accent Lighting</li>
</ul>
<p>By localizing your lighting, you can create the right kind of light at that moment. If you're entertaining guests in a large room, your overhead lighting will suffice. If it's a more intimate setting, a table lamp with the right lamp shade will offer plenty of light without the harshness of your ceiling lights.</p>
<h2>Recessed Lighting</h2>
<p>Recessed lighting can also be used as directional lighting, which can be pointed towards the wall, or in some cases even up the wall. By bouncing lights of your walls, it makes a room appear larger.</p>
<h2>Dimmers = Can't Live Without It</h2>
<p>Dimmers are the ultimate mood setters. It gives you control on how bright you want your room to be, plus they're very easy to install. Here's a <a href="http://www.diynetwork.com/how-to/skills-and-know-how/electrical-and-wiring/how-to-install-a-dimmer-switch">simple guide</a> on installing dimmer switches.</p>
<p>Dimmers give you versatility and the ability to have better control of the lighting in your home. They're inexpensive but make a big impact.</p>
<h2>Different Bulbs For Different Needs</h2>
<p>Choosing the right bulb for each room and light source is important as they all perform very differently.</p>
<p><strong>Incandescent:</strong> The old light bulbs that produce a warm, inviting light. However, they're hot to the touch and are very inefficient. These are becoming very hard to find as they're being phased out by more energy-efficient options.</p>
<p><strong>Compact Florescent Bulbs (CFLs): </strong>These bulbs are significantly more efficient than incandescent bulbs (75% more efficient!). They last significantly longer and emit a cooler light.</p>
<p><strong>LEDs: </strong>As efficient as CFLs but have a much more direct and slightly harsher light. LEDs are best used for task lighting.</p>
<p><strong>Halogen: </strong>These give off a bright white light. Many people choose to use these lights in bathrooms and basements, but they also work well for general task lighting.</p>
<h2>Shake It Up With Shades</h2>
<p>To easily invigorate a room, try replacing your lamp shade. Different lamp shades will be able to give you the type of light you need. For example, using a darker lamp shade in a bedroom can soften the light but still allow you to read in bed comfortably.</p>
